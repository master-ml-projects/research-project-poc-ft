Hmm, let me write that down again to make sure I have it right.\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAlright, so it's the product of sqrt(x) and the difference of two cube roots. Since x is going to infinity, both x+1 and x-1 are going to be very close to x when x is large. But their cube roots might differ by a small amount, and multiplying by sqrt(x) could amplify that difference. The question is whether this product approaches a finite limit, zero, or infinity.\\n\\nI remember that when dealing with limits involving roots, especially differences of roots, expanding them using binomial approximations or using the conjugate can be helpful. But cube roots are a bit trickier than square roots. Let me think.\\n\\nFor square roots, we often multiply by the conjugate to rationalize. For cube roots, maybe we can use the formula for a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). So if I let a = cube root of (x+1) and b = cube root of (x-1), then a^3 - b^3 = (x+1) - (x-1) = 2. Therefore, a - b = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). So maybe I can express the difference of the cube roots as 2 divided by the sum of their squares and their product. Then multiply by sqrt(x). Let's try that.\\n\\nLet me set a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}. Then, as I said, a - b = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). Therefore, the original expression becomes sqrt(x) * 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). So:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * 2 / [ ( (x + 1)^{2/3} + (x + 1)^{1/3}(x - 1)^{1/3} + (x - 1)^{2/3} ) ]\\n\\nHmm, okay. So the denominator is a sum of three terms. Each of these terms is something raised to the 2/3 power or the product of two terms raised to the 1/3 power. Maybe I can factor out x from each term in the cube roots?\\n\\nLet's try to approximate these terms for large x. Since x is approaching infinity, x + 1 ≈ x and x - 1 ≈ x. So maybe I can write (x + 1)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} and similarly for (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3}. Then, using the binomial approximation for (1 + ε)^k ≈ 1 + kε when ε is small.\\n\\nLet me expand each term:\\n\\nFirst, (x + 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\\n\\nSimilarly, (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\\n\\nTherefore, their difference, (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}[ (1 + 1/(3x)) - (1 - 1/(3x)) ] = x^{1/3}(2/(3x)) = 2/(3x^{2/3})\\n\\nWait, but the original expression is sqrt(x) times this difference. So sqrt(x) times 2/(3x^{2/3}) = 2/(3x^{2/3 - 1/2}) = 2/(3x^{1/6}) ) → 0 as x → ∞. But that would imply the limit is zero. But is that right?\\n\\nWait, but maybe the approximation is too crude? Because the higher-order terms might contribute when multiplied by sqrt(x). Let's check this again.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I need to be more precise with the expansion. Let me denote t = 1/x, so as x → ∞, t → 0. Then, (x + 1)^{1/3} = (x(1 + t))^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 + t)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + ... )\\n\\nSimilarly, (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + ... )\\n\\nSubtracting these two, we get:\\n\\nx^{1/3}[ (1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) - (1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) ) ] = x^{1/3}[ (2/3)t - (2/9)t^2 + ... ] = x^{1/3}[ (2/3)(1/x) - (2/9)(1/x^2) + ... ]\\n\\nSo the difference (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ (2/3)x^{-2/3} - (2/9)x^{-5/3} + ...\\n\\nMultiplying this by sqrt(x) = x^{1/2}:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * [ (2/3)x^{-2/3} - (2/9)x^{-5/3} + ... ] = (2/3)x^{1/2 - 2/3} - (2/9)x^{1/2 - 5/3} + ... = (2/3)x^{-1/6} - (2/9)x^{-7/6} + ...\\n\\nAs x approaches infinity, x^{-1/6} approaches 0 and x^{-7/6} approaches 0 even faster. Therefore, the entire expression tends to 0. So according to this approximation, the limit is zero. But wait, I recall that sometimes when you have differences of roots multiplied by a certain power, the limit can be a finite number. Maybe my approximation is missing something?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe using the expansion with more terms? Let me check.\\n\\nWait, but perhaps instead of expanding each cube root separately, I should apply the mean value theorem. For a function f(t) = t^{1/3}, the difference f(x+1) - f(x-1) can be approximated by f'(c)(2), where c is between x - 1 and x + 1. Then, by the mean value theorem, there exists c in (x - 1, x + 1) such that:\\n\\nf(x + 1) - f(x - 1) = f'(c) * 2\\n\\nSo f'(c) = (1/3)c^{-2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is 2/(3c^{2/3})\\n\\nThen, the original expression is sqrt(x) * 2/(3c^{2/3})\\n\\nSince c is between x - 1 and x + 1, as x approaches infinity, c is approximately x. Therefore, c^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, sqrt(x) * 2/(3x^{2/3}) = (2/3) x^{1/2 - 2/3} = (2/3) x^{-1/6} → 0 as x → ∞\\n\\nSo this also suggests the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut maybe there's a mistake here? Because sometimes when using approximations, if the higher order terms are significant when multiplied by another term, but in this case, both methods give zero. Maybe the limit is indeed zero. But let's try another approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the identity for a^3 - b^3 as I initially thought.\\n\\nSo, we have:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * (a - b) = sqrt(x) * ( (a^3 - b^3) / (a^2 + ab + b^2) ) = sqrt(x) * 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2)\\n\\nSince a = (x + 1)^{1/3}, b = (x - 1)^{1/3}\\n\\nSo, a^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 + 2/(3x)), b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - 2/(3x)), and ab ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - 1/(3x^2)) ?\\n\\nWait, let me compute each term:\\n\\nFirst, a^2 = (x + 1)^{2/3} = x^{2/3}(1 + 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}(1 + (2/3)(1/x) - (2/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\\n\\nSimilarly, b^2 = (x - 1)^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (2/3)(1/x) - (2/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\\n\\nab = (x + 1)^{1/3}(x - 1)^{1/3} = [ (x + 1)(x - 1) ]^{1/3} = (x^2 - 1)^{1/3} = x^{2/3}(1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (1/3)(1/x^2) + ... )\\n\\nTherefore, the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}[ (1 + 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 1/(3x^2)) ]\\n\\nWait, let's compute term by term:\\n\\na^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 + (2/(3x)) - (2/(9x^2)))\\n\\nb^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (2/(3x)) - (2/(9x^2)))\\n\\nab ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (1/(3x^2)))\\n\\nAdding these together:\\n\\na^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}[ (1 + 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 1/(3x^2)) ]\\n\\nCombine the constants:\\n\\n1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\n\\nThe terms with 1/x:\\n\\n(2/(3x) - 2/(3x)) = 0\\n\\nThe terms with 1/x^2:\\n\\n-2/(9x^2) -2/(9x^2) -1/(3x^2) = (-4/9 - 3/9)/x^2 = (-7/9)/x^2\\n\\nTherefore, overall:\\n\\na^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(3 - 7/(9x^2))\\n\\nSo, the denominator is approximately 3x^{2/3}, and the correction term is negligible as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, the original expression is sqrt(x) * 2 / (3x^{2/3}) = (2/3) x^{1/2 - 2/3} = (2/3) x^{-1/6} → 0 as x → ∞\\n\\nHmm, so all three methods: binomial expansion, mean value theorem, and the a^3 - b^3 identity lead to the conclusion that the limit is zero. So maybe the answer is zero.\\n\\nBut wait, maybe there is an error here. Let me check with concrete numbers. Let me plug in a very large x, say x = 10^6, and compute the value numerically.\\n\\nCompute sqrt(10^6) * ( (10^6 +1)^{1/3} - (10^6 -1)^{1/3} )\\n\\nsqrt(10^6) = 1000.\\n\\nNow, (10^6 +1)^{1/3} ≈ 100^{2} * (1 + 1/(10^6))^{1/3} ≈ 100^2 * (1 + 1/(3*10^6)) = 10000 + 10000/(3*10^6) ≈ 10000 + 0.003333...\\n\\nSimilarly, (10^6 -1)^{1/3} ≈ 100^2 * (1 - 1/(10^6))^{1/3} ≈ 10000 - 10000/(3*10^6) ≈ 10000 - 0.003333...\\n\\nSo their difference is approximately 0.006666...\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = 1000: 0.006666... * 1000 ≈ 6.666...\\n\\nWait, that's around 6.666, which is 20/3 ≈ 6.666... So this contradicts the previous analytical results that suggested the limit is zero. But when I plug in x = 10^6, the value is approximately 20/3. That's unexpected. Therefore, my previous analytical approach must be flawed.\\n\\nWait, what? So according to numerical evaluation, when x is 10^6, the expression is about 6.666, which is 20/3, but when x approaches infinity, is this approaching a finite limit or going to infinity?\\n\\nWait, but x=10^6 is large, but maybe the limit is a finite number, not zero. So why the discrepancy?\\n\\nWait, my mistake in numerical calculation. Wait, hold on. Let me redo the numerical example more carefully.\\n\\nWait, x = 10^6, so x +1 = 1000001, x -1 = 999999.\\n\\nCompute cube roots:\\n\\nFirst, (10^6)^{1/3} = 100, because (100)^3 = 1,000,000. So 10^6 is (100)^3.\\n\\nTherefore, (10^6 +1)^{1/3} is slightly more than 100, and (10^6 -1)^{1/3} is slightly less than 100.\\n\\nLet me compute the difference:\\n\\nLet me use the binomial approximation for (100^3 + 1)^{1/3} = 100*(1 + 1/100^3)^{1/3} ≈ 100*(1 + 1/(3*100^3)) = 100 + 1/(3*100^2) = 100 + 1/30000 ≈ 100.0000333333\\n\\nSimilarly, (100^3 -1)^{1/3} ≈ 100*(1 - 1/100^3)^{1/3} ≈ 100*(1 - 1/(3*100^3)) = 100 - 1/(3*100^3) = 100 - 1/3000000 ≈ 99.9999996667\\n\\nTherefore, the difference between the two cube roots is approximately 100.0000333333 - 99.9999996667 ≈ 0.0000336666\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = sqrt(10^6) = 1000:\\n\\n0.0000336666 * 1000 ≈ 0.0336666\\n\\nWhich is approximately 0.0337, which is roughly 1/30, which is approximately 0.0333. So in reality, the numerical value is about 0.0337, not 6.666. So my previous calculation was wrong because I miscalculated the cube roots.\\n\\nWait, so 10^6 is (100)^3, so cube root of 10^6 is 100. Then, adding or subtracting 1 would change the cube root by a tiny amount, as shown. So the difference is approximately 0.0000333333, and multiplied by 1000 gives approximately 0.0333, which is 1/30. Wait, 1/30 is approximately 0.0333. So then, this suggests that the limit might be 2/3 / 2? Wait, but 0.0333 is 1/30, which is approximately 0.0333. Wait, but 2/3 divided by 10 is 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0666. Hmm, perhaps not.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the limit is 2/(3*2) = 1/3. Hmm, but 0.0333 is 1/30. So perhaps my numerical evaluation is conflicting with analytical?\\n\\nWait, maybe my analytical approach was wrong. Let me re-examine the steps.\\n\\nSo, earlier, using the binomial expansion, I approximated (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ 2/(3x^{2/3}) - 2/(9x^{5/3}) + ... Then multiplied by sqrt(x) gives (2/3)x^{-1/6} - (2/9)x^{-7/6} + ..., which tends to zero. But the numerical example with x = 10^6 gave approximately 0.0333, which is 1/30, which is x^{-1/6} evaluated at x=10^6: (10^6)^{-1/6} = 10^{-1} = 0.1, then 2/3 * 0.1 ≈ 0.0666, but my numerical calculation gave 0.0333. So there is a discrepancy.\\n\\nWait, that suggests that the next term is subtracting something. Let's compute the exact difference.\\n\\nLet me compute the exact difference for x=10^6.\\n\\nCompute (10^6 +1)^{1/3} - (10^6 -1)^{1/3}.\\n\\nLet me use the identity a - b = (a^3 - b^3)/(a^2 + ab + b^2)\\n\\nHere, a = (10^6 +1)^{1/3}, b = (10^6 -1)^{1/3}\\n\\nThen, a^3 - b^3 = (10^6 +1) - (10^6 -1) = 2\\n\\nThe denominator is a^2 + ab + b^2. Since a and b are both approximately 100, a ≈ 100 + δ, b ≈ 100 - δ, where δ is small.\\n\\nCompute a^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ (100 + δ)^2 + (100 + δ)(100 - δ) + (100 - δ)^2\\n\\nExpand:\\n\\n(100^2 + 200δ + δ^2) + (100^2 - δ^2) + (100^2 - 200δ + δ^2)\\n\\n= 100^2 + 200δ + δ^2 + 100^2 - δ^2 + 100^2 - 200δ + δ^2\\n\\nCombine like terms:\\n\\n3*100^2 + (200δ - 200δ) + (δ^2 - δ^2 + δ^2)\\n\\n= 3*10000 + δ^2\\n\\n= 30000 + δ^2\\n\\nSince δ is very small, δ ≈ (a - 100) ≈ derivative of x^{1/3} at x=10^6 times 1. The derivative is (1/3)x^{-2/3}, so δ ≈ (1/3)*(10^6)^{-2/3} = (1/3)*(100)^{-4/3} = (1/3)*(100^{-1}) )? Wait, (10^6)^{2/3} = (10^6)^{2/3} = 10^{4} = 10000. So derivative is (1/3)*10^{-4} = 1/30000. So δ ≈ 1/(3*10^4) = 0.000033333...\\n\\nTherefore, δ^2 ≈ (1/9)*10^{-8} = negligible.\\n\\nTherefore, denominator ≈ 30000\\n\\nTherefore, a - b ≈ 2 / 30000 = 1 / 15000 ≈ 0.000066666...\\n\\nBut wait, in reality, when we compute a - b numerically, we found approximately 0.000033333... Wait, this is conflicting.\\n\\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, in reality, the cube roots of 10^6 +1 and 10^6 -1 are 100.000033333... and 99.999966666..., so their difference is 0.000066666..., which is 2/(3*10^4) = 2/30000 = 1/15000 ≈ 0.000066666...\\n\\nBut when I multiplied by sqrt(x) = 1000, that gives 1000 * 0.000066666... ≈ 0.066666..., which is 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.066666...\\n\\nBut earlier, my numerical approximation said 0.0333, but that was incorrect. Wait, maybe my first numerical calculation was wrong.\\n\\nWait, let me compute (10^6 +1)^{1/3} and (10^6 -1)^{1/3} more accurately.\\n\\nFirst, (10^6)^{1/3} = 100. Let's compute 100^3 = 1,000,000.\\n\\nCompute (100 + Δ)^3 = 1,000,000 +1. Let me solve for Δ:\\n\\n(100 + Δ)^3 = 100^3 + 3*100^2*Δ + 3*100*Δ^2 + Δ^3 = 1,000,000 + 30,000Δ + 300Δ^2 + Δ^3 = 1,000,001.\\n\\nTherefore, 30,000Δ + 300Δ^2 + Δ^3 = 1.\\n\\nAssuming Δ is very small, the Δ^2 and Δ^3 terms are negligible, so 30,000Δ ≈ 1 → Δ ≈ 1/30,000 ≈ 0.000033333...\\n\\nTherefore, (10^6 +1)^{1/3} ≈ 100 + 1/30,000\\n\\nSimilarly, (10^6 -1)^{1/3} ≈ 100 - 1/30,000\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is (100 + 1/30,000) - (100 - 1/30,000) = 2/30,000 = 1/15,000 ≈ 0.000066666...\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(10^6) = 1000: 1/15,000 * 1000 = 1000/15,000 = 1/15 ≈ 0.066666...\\n\\nSo the correct numerical value is approximately 0.0666..., which is 2/30 = 1/15. Wait, but according to the analytical result earlier, the leading term was (2/3) x^{-1/6}. For x = 10^6, x^{-1/6} = (10^6)^{-1/6} = 10^{-1} = 0.1, so (2/3)*0.1 ≈ 0.066666..., which matches the numerical result. Then, according to the expansion, the next term is -(2/9)x^{-7/6}, which for x=10^6 is -(2/9)*(10^6)^{-7/6} = -(2/9)*10^{-7} ≈ -0.0000000222..., which is negligible. Therefore, the leading term is indeed 0.0666..., which is 2/3 * 0.1 = 0.0666...\\n\\nTherefore, this suggests that as x increases, the expression approaches zero, because x^{-1/6} tends to zero. However, when x = 10^6, the value is still 0.0666..., which is 1/15, and for larger x, it would be smaller. For example, x = 10^{12}, x^{-1/6} = 10^{-2} = 0.01, so (2/3)*0.01 ≈ 0.006666..., which is 1/150. So as x increases, the expression tends to zero. Therefore, the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut wait, then why does the numerical example with x=10^6 give 0.0666, which is non-zero? Because x^{-1/6} approaches zero, but very slowly. For example, to get x^{-1/6} = 0.01, you need x = 10^6. To get x^{-1/6} = 0.001, you need x = 10^{18}, which is extremely large. So even though the limit is zero, for practical purposes, even at x=10^6, the value is still around 0.0666.\\n\\nBut mathematically, as x approaches infinity, x^{-1/6} approaches zero, so the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut now I'm confused because my initial expansion suggested that the difference (x +1)^{1/3} - (x -1)^{1/3} is approximately 2/(3x^{2/3}), and multiplying by sqrt(x) gives 2/(3x^{1/6}), which tends to zero. But let me check with another example. Suppose x approaches infinity, then x^{1/6} also approaches infinity, so 1/x^{1/6} approaches zero.\\n\\nWait, yes. For example, x^{1/6} is the sixth root of x. So as x becomes larger, x^{1/6} increases, so 1/x^{1/6} decreases to zero. Therefore, the expression 2/(3x^{1/6}) tends to zero. Therefore, the limit should be zero.\\n\\nBut the numerical evaluation shows that even at x = 10^6, which is large, the value is 0.0666, which is 2/(3*10^{1/6})?\\n\\nWait, no. Wait, x = 10^6, so x^{1/6} = (10^6)^{1/6} = 10^{1} = 10. So 2/(3*10) = 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0666..., which matches the numerical result. Therefore, the general term is 2/(3x^{1/6}), which tends to zero as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, the limit is zero. Therefore, both analytical approaches and numerical evaluation confirm that, although the expression approaches zero very slowly (since x^{-1/6} decays slowly), it still approaches zero.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer should be zero.\\n\\nWait, but another thought: perhaps when expanding the cube roots, I should have considered higher-order terms?\\n\\nWait, let's use a more accurate expansion.\\n\\nLet me write (x + 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}[1 + (1/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) + (5/(81x^3)) - ... ] using the binomial expansion up to the third term.\\n\\nSimilarly, (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}[1 - (1/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) - (5/(81x^3)) - ... ]\\n\\nSubtracting these two:\\n\\n(x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}[ (2/(3x)) - (10/(81x^3)) + ... ] = (2/(3x^{2/3})) - (10/(81x^{8/3)) + ...\\n\\nMultiplying by sqrt(x) = x^{1/2}:\\n\\nx^{1/2}*(2/(3x^{2/3})) - x^{1/2}*(10/(81x^{8/3)) ) = (2/3)x^{-1/6} - (10/81)x^{-13/6} + ...\\n\\nSo as x approaches infinity, the first term tends to zero, and the second term tends to zero even faster. So indeed, the limit is zero.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the expansion up to the second term:\\n\\nThe difference is approximately (2/(3x^{2/3})) - (2/(9x^{5/3})). Multiplying by x^{1/2}:\\n\\n(2/3)x^{-1/6} - (2/9)x^{-7/6}, both terms go to zero.\\n\\nTherefore, all expansions confirm that the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut wait, another approach: let me set t = 1/x, so as x → ∞, t → 0. Then rewrite the expression in terms of t.\\n\\nLet x = 1/t, so t → 0+.\\n\\nThe expression becomes sqrt(1/t) * [ ( (1/t + 1)^{1/3} - (1/t - 1)^{1/3} ) ] = (1/sqrt(t)) [ ( ( (1 + t)/t )^{1/3} - ( (1 - t)/t )^{1/3} ) ]\\n\\nSimplify inside the cube roots:\\n\\n( (1 + t)/t )^{1/3} = (1/t + 1)^{1/3} = (1/t)^{1/3}(1 + t)^{1/3} = t^{-1/3}(1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + ... )\\n\\nSimilarly, ( (1 - t)/t )^{1/3} = t^{-1/3}(1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - ... )\\n\\nSubtracting:\\n\\nt^{-1/3}[ (1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) - (1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) ) ] = t^{-1/3}[ (2/3)t - (2/9)t^2 + ... ] = (2/3)t^{2/3} - (2/9)t^{5/3} + ...\\n\\nMultiply by (1/sqrt(t)) = t^{-1/2}:\\n\\n(2/3)t^{2/3 - 1/2} - (2/9)t^{5/3 - 1/2} + ... = (2/3)t^{1/6} - (2/9)t^{7/6} + ...\\n\\nAs t → 0+, t^{1/6} → 0, so the entire expression tends to zero.\\n\\nThus, regardless of the approach, the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut the numerical example with x=10^6 gave approximately 0.0666, which is 2/3 * x^{-1/6} = 2/3 * (10^6)^{-1/6} = 2/3 * 10^{-1} = 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0666. So for finite x, even very large, the value is non-zero, but as x grows without bound, it tends to zero.\\n\\nTherefore, the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the numerical calculation earlier where I thought the value was 1/30. No, in reality, when corrected, it's 1/15, which aligns with the analytical result.\\n\\nTherefore, after careful consideration and multiple approaches, I conclude that the limit is zero.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{0}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo evaluate the limit \\\\(\\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\\\right)\\\\), we can use several approaches including binomial expansion, the mean value theorem, and algebraic manipulation.\\n\\n1. **Binomial Expansion**:\\n   - Approximate \\\\((x + 1)^{1/3}\\\\) and \\\\((x - 1)^{1/3}\\\\) using binomial expansion for large \\\\(x\\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     (x + 1)^{1/3} \\\\approx x^{1/3} \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{3x} - \\\\frac{1}{9x^2} + \\\\cdots \\\\right)\\n     \\\\]\\n     \\\\[\\n     (x - 1)^{1/3} \\\\approx x^{1/3} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{3x} - \\\\frac{1}{9x^2} + \\\\cdots \\\\right)\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Subtract the expansions:\\n     \\\\[\\n     (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} \\\\approx x^{1/3} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{3x} - \\\\frac{2}{9x^2} + \\\\cdots \\\\right) = \\\\frac{2}{3} x^{-2/3} - \\\\frac{2}{9} x^{-5/3} + \\\\cdots\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Multiply by \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x}\\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{3} x^{-2/3} - \\\\frac{2}{9} x^{-5/3} + \\\\cdots \\\\right) = \\\\frac{2}{3} x^{-1/6} - \\\\frac{2}{9} x^{-7/6} + \\\\cdots\\n     \\\\]\\n   - As \\\\(x \\\\to \\\\infty\\\\), the terms \\\\(x^{-1/6}\\\\) and \\\\(x^{-7/6}\\\\) approach zero.\\n\\n2. **Mean Value Theorem**:\\n   - Let \\\\(f(t) = t^{1/3}\\\\).

       " 'r1_solution_2': \"Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as x approaches infinity of sqrt(x) times (the cube root of (x+1) minus the cube root of (x-1)).

So the expression is sqrt(x) multiplied by the difference of two cube roots. Both cube roots are of expressions that are close to x when x is large. So maybe I can approximate the difference between the cube roots?\\n\\nFirst, let me recall that for large x, (x + 1) and (x - 1) are both approximately x. But their cube roots will be approximately cube root of x. However, there's a small difference between them, and when multiplied by sqrt(x), which is also growing, the limit might not be zero. So I need to find a way to expand the cube roots to get a better approximation of their difference.\\n\\nOne technique I remember for dealing with differences of roots is to use the identity a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}). But in this case, we have cube roots, so maybe I can write the difference as (x+1)^{1/3} - (x-1)^{1/3} and then factor out x^{1/3} from both terms?\\n\\nLet me try that. Let's factor x^{1/3} from each cube root:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} = \\\\sqrt[3]{x \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)} = x^{1/3} \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimilarly,\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} = \\\\sqrt[3]{x \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)} = x^{1/3} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSo the difference becomes:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nx^{1/3} \\\\left[ \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} - \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} \\\\right]\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThen, the original expression is sqrt(x) times this, which is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sqrt{x} \\\\cdot x^{1/3} \\\\left[ \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} - \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} \\\\right] = x^{1/2 + 1/3} \\\\left[ \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} - \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} \\\\right]\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAdding the exponents: 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So that's x^{5/6} times the difference in brackets.\\n\\nNow, I need to approximate the term in brackets. For small h, (1 + h)^{1/3} can be expanded using the Taylor series or binomial approximation. Since 1/x is small when x is large, I can use the expansion:\\n\\n(1 + h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + ... and similarly for (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + ...\\n\\nWait, let me check that. The binomial expansion for (1 + h)^k around h=0 is 1 + kh + (k(k - 1)/2)h² + ..., so for k = 1/3:\\n\\n(1 + h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + (5/81)h³ - ... and so on.\\n\\nSimilarly, (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (5/81)h³ - ...\\n\\nTherefore, subtracting these two expansions:\\n\\n(1 + h)^{1/3} - (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ [1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h²] - [1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h²] = (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (-1/3)h - (-1/9)h²) Wait, let me compute term by term:\\n\\nFirst term: 1 - 1 = 0\\n\\nSecond term: (1/3)h - (-1/3)h = (2/3)h\\n\\nThird term: - (1/9)h² - ( -1/9)h² = 0\\n\\nFourth term: (5/81)h³ - (-5/81)h³ = (10/81)h³\\n\\nBut since h is 1/x, which is very small, maybe up to the h term is sufficient? Let's see.\\n\\nWait, if h = 1/x, then h² = 1/x², which is much smaller than h. So if we approximate up to h, then the difference is (2/3)h. But is that enough? Let's check.\\n\\nIf we take the expansion up to h, then (1 + h)^{1/3} - (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ (2/3)h. However, we are multiplying this difference by x^{5/6}. Let's see:\\n\\nOriginal expression: x^{5/6} * [ (2/3)h + higher order terms ]\\n\\nBut h = 1/x, so substituting h:\\n\\nx^{5/6} * [ (2/3)(1/x) + ... ] = (2/3) x^{5/6 - 1} + ... = (2/3) x^{-1/6} + ... which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity. But this contradicts my initial thought that the limit might not be zero. Hmm, but maybe the first term cancels out, and the next term is needed?\\n\\nWait, maybe I need to go to the next term in the expansion. Let's try expanding up to h³.\\n\\nSo, as per earlier, (1 + h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + (5/81)h³\\n\\nSimilarly, (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (5/81)h³\\n\\nSubtracting them:\\n\\n[1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + (5/81)h³] - [1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (5/81)h³]\\n\\n= (1 - 1) + [(1/3)h + (1/3)h] + [(-1/9)h² + (1/9)h²] + [(5/81)h³ + (5/81)h³]\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n= (2/3)h + 0 + (10/81)h³\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is (2/3)h + (10/81)h³ + higher order terms.\\n\\nSo plugging h = 1/x, we get:\\n\\n(2/3)(1/x) + (10/81)(1/x³) + ...\\n\\nThen, multiplying by x^{5/6}:\\n\\nx^{5/6} * [ (2/3)x^{-1} + (10/81)x^{-3} + ... ] = (2/3) x^{5/6 - 1} + (10/81) x^{5/6 - 3} + ... = (2/3) x^{-1/6} + (10/81) x^{-13/6} + ...\\n\\nAs x approaches infinity, x^{-1/6} approaches 0, and the other terms are even smaller. So according to this, the limit would be 0. But I need to check if this is accurate.\\n\\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the expansion. Let me double-check the coefficients. The binomial expansion for (1 + h)^k is:\\n\\n1 + kh + \\\\frac{k(k - 1)}{2} h² + \\\\frac{k(k - 1)(k - 2)}{6} h³ + ...\\n\\nSo for k = 1/3:\\n\\nFirst term: 1\\n\\nSecond term: (1/3)h\\n\\nThird term: (1/3)(1/3 - 1)/2 h² = (1/3)(-2/3)/2 h² = (-1/9)h²\\n\\nFourth term: (1/3)(-2/3)(-5/3)/6 h³ = (1/3)(-2/3)(-5/3)/6 = (10/81)h³\\n\\nSo yes, that's correct. So up to h³, the expansion is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is (2/3)h + (10/81)h³ + ... So when h = 1/x, substituting:\\n\\n(2/3)(1/x) + (10/81)(1/x³) + ...\\n\\nTherefore, multiplying by x^{5/6} gives:\\n\\n(2/3) x^{-1/6} + (10/81) x^{-13/6} + ... which goes to 0 as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nWait, but that suggests the limit is 0. Is that correct? Let me try to plug in some large x to test.\\n\\nSuppose x is 1,000,000. Then sqrt(x) is 1000. The cube roots:\\n\\nCube root of 1,000,001 vs cube root of 999,999.\\n\\nCube root of 1,000,000 is 100. Then, the cube root of 1,000,001 is approximately 100 + (1)/(3*100²) = 100 + 1/(30,000) ≈ 100.000033333. Similarly, cube root of 999,999 is approximately 100 - 1/(3*100²) ≈ 99.999966666. The difference between them is approximately 0.000066666. Multiply by sqrt(x) = 1000: 0.000066666 * 1000 ≈ 0.066666..., which is about 2/30 ≈ 1/15 ≈ 0.0667. But as x increases, what happens?\\n\\nWait, when x is 1,000,000, we get approx 0.0667, but if x increases further, say x = 10^12, then sqrt(x) is 10^6, and the difference in cube roots would be approx (2)/(3x^{2/3}) because derivative of x^{1/3} is (1/3)x^{-2/3}, so difference approx 2*(1/(3x^{2/3})). Then sqrt(x)*difference is sqrt(x)*(2/(3x^{2/3})) = 2/(3x^{2/3 - 1/2}) = 2/(3x^{1/6}). So as x increases, this expression tends to 0. So for x=10^12, x^{1/6}=10^2=100, so 2/(3*100)=1/150≈0.006666..., which is smaller. So indeed, as x increases, the expression tends to 0. So maybe the limit is 0.\\n\\nBut wait, when I plug in x=1,000,000, I get around 0.0666, and when x=10^12, it's 0.00666, so it's approaching 0. Hence, perhaps the limit is indeed 0. But let me check with another approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the mean value theorem. For a function f(t) = t^{1/3}, the difference f(x+1) - f(x-1) can be written as f'(c)(2), where c is between x-1 and x+1. By the mean value theorem, there exists c in (x-1, x+1) such that:\\n\\nf(x+1) - f(x-1) = f'(c)*(2)\\n\\nSo f'(c) = (1/3)c^{-2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is (2/3)c^{-2/3}\\n\\nSo substituting back into the original expression:\\n\\nsqrt(x)*(2/(3c^{2/3}))\\n\\nSince c is between x-1 and x+1, as x approaches infinity, c is approximately x. Therefore, c^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, sqrt(x)/(x^{2/3}) = x^{1/2 - 2/3} = x^{-1/6} which approaches 0 as x approaches infinity. Hence, the limit is 0.\\n\\nBut wait, but when I computed with x=1,000,000, I had approx 0.0666, which is 2/(3*100) = 2/300 ≈ 0.006666, but wait, no. Wait, x=1,000,000, c≈x, so c^{2/3} = (10^6)^{2/3}=10^{4}=10,000. So sqrt(x) is 1000. So sqrt(x)/c^{2/3}=1000/10,000=1/10. Then multiplied by 2/3: 2/3*1/10≈0.0666. Which matches the earlier approximation. So for x=1,000,000, it's 0.0666, but as x increases, sqrt(x)/c^{2/3}=x^{1/2}/x^{2/3}=x^{-1/6}, which is x^{-1/6}. Therefore, as x approaches infinity, this term approaches 0. So indeed, the limit should be 0.\\n\\nBut I need to check if there is a miscalculation here. Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me set t = 1/x, so as x approaches infinity, t approaches 0. Then rewrite the expression in terms of t.\\n\\nLet x = 1/t, so when x approaches infinity, t approaches 0 from the positive side.\\n\\nSo the expression becomes:\\n\\nsqrt(1/t) [ ( (1/t + 1)^{1/3} - (1/t - 1)^{1/3} ) ]\\n\\nBut wait, (1/t + 1) = (1 + t)/t, and (1/t - 1) = (1 - t)/t. Wait, no:\\n\\nWait, x = 1/t, so x + 1 = 1/t + 1 = (1 + t)/t, and x -1 = 1/t -1 = (1 - t)/t.\\n\\nTherefore, cube roots become:\\n\\n[(1 + t)/t]^{1/3} - [(1 - t)/t]^{1/3} = t^{-1/3} [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ]\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression is:\\n\\nsqrt(1/t) * t^{-1/3} [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ]\\n\\nsqrt(1/t) is t^{-1/2}, so multiplied by t^{-1/3} gives t^{-1/2 -1/3} = t^{-5/6}\\n\\nSo the expression becomes:\\n\\nt^{-5/6} [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ]\\n\\nNow, expand (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} using the binomial expansion for small t:\\n\\nAs before, (1 + t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t² + (5/81)t³ - ...\\n\\n(1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t² - (5/81)t³ + ...\\n\\nSubtracting them:\\n\\n[1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t² + ...] - [1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t² - ...] = (2/3)t + (10/81)t³ + ...\\n\\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\\n\\nt^{-5/6} [ (2/3)t + (10/81)t³ + ... ] = (2/3) t^{1 - 5/6} + (10/81) t^{3 -5/6} + ... = (2/3) t^{1/6} + (10/81) t^{13/6} + ...\\n\\nAs t approaches 0, t^{1/6} approaches 0, and the other terms also approach 0. Therefore, the limit is 0.\\n\\nHmm. So all these methods seem to indicate that the limit is 0. But when I plug in x=1,000,000, I get approximately 0.0666, which is not 0. However, since we're taking the limit as x approaches infinity, even though for finite x the value is non-zero, it tends to 0 as x grows larger. For example, if x=10^12, as I computed earlier, the value would be around 0.00666, which is smaller, and as x increases further, it keeps getting smaller. So that does make sense. Therefore, the limit should be 0.\\n\\nBut let me think again. Maybe there is a different approach? For example, using L’Hospital’s Rule. Wait, but this is an indeterminate form of type ∞ * 0. To apply L’Hospital’s Rule, I need to convert it into a 0/0 or ∞/∞ form.\\n\\nLet me rewrite the original expression:\\n\\nlim_{x→∞} sqrt(x) [ (x+1)^{1/3} - (x-1)^{1/3} ]\\n\\nLet me denote the expression as sqrt(x) * [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] where f(t) = t^{1/3}\\n\\nAlternatively, we can write this as [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] / (1/sqrt(x))\\n\\nSo as x approaches infinity, the numerator tends to 0 and the denominator tends to 0, so it's a 0/0 form. Therefore, maybe L’Hospital’s Rule applies here. Let's try that.\\n\\nLet me set it up:\\n\\nlim_{x→∞} [ (x+1)^{1/3} - (x-1)^{1/3} ] / (1/sqrt(x)) = lim_{x→∞} [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] / (x^{-1/2})\\n\\nNow, take derivatives of numerator and denominator with respect to x:\\n\\nThe derivative of the numerator:\\n\\nd/dx [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] = f’(x+1)*(1) - f’(x-1)*(1) = (1/3)(x+1)^{-2/3} - (1/3)(x-1)^{-2/3}\\n\\nThe derivative of the denominator:\\n\\nd/dx [x^{-1/2}] = (-1/2)x^{-3/2}\\n\\nTherefore, applying L’Hospital’s Rule, the limit becomes:\\n\\nlim_{x→∞} [ (1/3)(x+1)^{-2/3} - (1/3)(x-1)^{-2/3} ] / [ (-1/2)x^{-3/2} ]\\n\\nSimplify numerator:\\n\\n(1/3)[ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ]\\n\\nDenominator:\\n\\n(-1/2)x^{-3/2}\\n\\nTherefore, the expression is:\\n\\n(1/3) / (-1/2) * [ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] / x^{-3/2} = (-2/3) * [ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] / x^{-3/2}\\n\\nSimplify the division:\\n\\n[ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] / x^{-3/2} = [ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] * x^{3/2}\\n\\nAgain, we can factor out x^{-2/3} from both terms in the numerator:\\n\\n(x+1)^{-2/3} = x^{-2/3} (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3}\\n\\nSimilarly, (x-1)^{-2/3} = x^{-2/3} (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\\n\\nx^{-2/3} [ (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3} - (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3} ] * x^{3/2} = x^{-2/3 + 3/2} [ (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3} - (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3} ]\\n\\nCalculate exponent:\\n\\n-2/3 + 3/2 = (-4/6 + 9/6) = 5/6\\n\\nSo x^{5/6} [ (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3} - (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3} ]\\n\\nAgain, expand the terms inside the brackets using binomial approximation for h = 1/x:\\n\\n(1 + h)^{-2/3} ≈ 1 - (2/3)h + ( ( (-2/3)(-2/3 -1) ) / 2 ) h² + ...\\n\\nWhich is 1 - (2/3)h + ( (10/9)/2 ) h² = 1 - (2/3)h + (5/9)h² + ...\\n\\nSimilarly, (1 - h)^{-2/3} ≈ 1 + (2/3)h + ( ( (-2/3)(-2/3 -1) ) / 2 ) h² + ... = 1 + (2/3)h + (5/9)h² + ...\\n\\nSubtracting them:\\n\\n[1 - (2/3)h + (5/9)h²] - [1 + (2/3)h + (5/9)h²] = - (4/3)h + 0 h² + ... = - (4/3)h + ...\\n\\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\\n\\nx^{5/6} [ - (4/3)h + ... ] = x^{5/6} [ - (4/3)(1/x) + ... ] = - (4/3) x^{5/6 -1} + ... = - (4/3) x^{-1/6} + ...\\n\\nWhich tends to 0 as x approaches infinity. Therefore, after applying L’Hospital’s Rule once, we still get an expression that tends to 0. Therefore, the original limit is 0.\\n\\nWait, but if after applying L’Hospital once, we still have an indeterminate form, can we apply it again? Let me check:\\n\\nThe expression after first derivative was:\\n\\nlim_{x→∞} - (4/3) x^{-1/6} + ... which is 0. So actually, after applying L’Hospital once, we have already shown that the limit is 0, so no need to apply it again.\\n\\nTherefore, all methods seem to confirm that the limit is 0. But I want to check another way just to be thorough.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution y = x^{1/6}, so that x = y^6. Then as x approaches infinity, y also approaches infinity.\\n\\nExpress the original limit in terms of y:\\n\\nsqrt(x) = sqrt(y^6) = y^3\\n\\nCube roots:\\n\\n(x +1)^{1/3} = (y^6 +1)^{1/3} ≈ y^2 (1 + 1/(y^6))^{1/3} ≈ y^2 (1 + 1/(3 y^6))\\n\\nSimilarly, (x -1)^{1/3} ≈ y^2 (1 - 1/(3 y^6))\\n\\nSubtracting them:\\n\\ny^2 [ (1 + 1/(3 y^6)) - (1 - 1/(3 y^6)) ] = y^2 [ 2/(3 y^6) ] = 2/(3 y^4)\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = y^3:\\n\\ny^3 * 2/(3 y^4) = 2/(3 y) which approaches 0 as y approaches infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, again, the limit is 0.\\n\\nSo all different methods—binomial expansion, mean value theorem, substitution, L’Hospital’s Rule—lead to the conclusion that the limit is 0. Therefore, I should feel confident that the answer is 0.\\n\\nBut just to make sure, let's consider another perspective. Suppose we write the difference of cube roots as:\\n\\n\\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} = \\\\frac{(x+1) - (x-1)}{(\\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2})}\\n\\nThis is using the identity a - b = (a^3 - b^3)/(a^2 + ab + b^2). Here, a = \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1}, b = \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1}, so a^3 - b^3 = (x+1) - (x-1) = 2.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n\\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} = 2 / [ (\\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2} ) ]\\n\\nSo the original expression becomes:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * [ 2 / ( (\\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2} ) ) ]\\n\\nNow, let's analyze the denominator:\\n\\nEach term in the denominator is approximately (x)^{2/3} for large x. For example:\\n\\n\\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 + 2/(3x))\\n\\nSimilarly, \\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} = \\\\sqrt[3]{x² -1} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 - 1/x²)^{1/3} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 - 1/(3x²))\\n\\nAnd \\\\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 - 2/(3x))\\n\\nTherefore, summing these three terms:\\n\\n≈ x^{2/3} [ (1 + 2/(3x)) + (1 - 1/(3x²)) + (1 - 2/(3x)) ] = x^{2/3} [ 3 - 1/(3x²) ]\\n\\nTherefore, the denominator ≈ 3 x^{2/3} - negligible terms.\\n\\nTherefore, the original expression ≈ sqrt(x) * [ 2 / (3 x^{2/3}) ] = (2/3) x^{1/2} / x^{2/3} = (2/3) x^{1/2 - 2/3} = (2/3) x^{-1/6} which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, again, the limit is 0.\\n\\nSo after considering multiple approaches—binomial expansion, mean value theorem, substitution, algebraic identity—all confirm that the limit is 0.

       " 'r1_solution_3': \"Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as x approaches infinity of sqrt(x) times (the cube root of (x+1) minus the cube root of (x-1)). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me write it out again to visualize better:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nFirst, let's recall that when dealing with limits involving roots, especially as variables approach infinity, it's often helpful to factor out the dominant term. Here, as x is going to infinity, the terms +1 and -1 inside the cube roots become negligible compared to x. But since we have a difference of two cube roots, maybe I need to use some algebraic manipulation to simplify this expression. \\n\\nI remember that for differences of roots, sometimes multiplying by the conjugate helps. For square roots, we multiply by the conjugate to rationalize. Maybe something similar works for cube roots? Let me think. The formula for a^3 - b^3 is (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). So, if I have a - b, where a and b are cube roots, maybe I can multiply numerator and denominator by something to rationalize them. But here, in our case, the expression is part of a product with sqrt(x). So perhaps I need to use this identity.\\n\\nLet me set a = cube root of (x + 1) and b = cube root of (x - 1). Then our expression becomes sqrt(x) * (a - b). If I can express (a - b) in terms that can be simplified, maybe the sqrt(x) will cancel out some terms, making the limit computable.\\n\\nUsing the identity a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2), so rearranged, (a - b) = (a^3 - b^3)/(a^2 + ab + b^2). Let's compute a^3 - b^3 first. Since a is cube root of (x + 1), a^3 is x + 1, and similarly, b^3 is x - 1. Therefore, a^3 - b^3 = (x + 1) - (x - 1) = x + 1 - x + 1 = 2. So, the numerator simplifies to 2. Therefore, (a - b) = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). \\n\\nSo, substituting back into our original expression, the limit becomes:\\n\\nlim_{x→∞} sqrt(x) * [2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2)]\\n\\nWhere a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}. Now, I need to analyze the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2.\\n\\nLet's try to express a and b in terms of x. Since x is approaching infinity, both (x + 1) and (x - 1) are approximately x. So, perhaps we can approximate a and b using a binomial expansion or a Taylor series. Let's consider that approach.\\n\\nFirst, let's write a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}. Let's factor out x from both terms. Then,\\n\\na = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3}\\n\\nSimilarly,\\n\\nb = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3}\\n\\nSo, both a and b can be expressed as x^{1/3} multiplied by a term that's close to 1 when x is large. Then, maybe I can use the expansion (1 + ε)^n ≈ 1 + nε + (n(n - 1)/2)ε^2 + ... for small ε.\\n\\nLet's apply this expansion to both (1 + 1/x)^{1/3} and (1 - 1/x)^{1/3}.\\n\\nFor a:\\n\\n(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... \\n\\nSimilarly, for b:\\n\\n(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... \\n\\nWait, hold on. The expansion of (1 + ε)^k is 1 + kε + (k(k - 1)/2)ε^2 + (k(k - 1)(k - 2)/6)ε^3 + ... For (1 - ε)^k, it's similar but with alternating signs: 1 - kε + (k(k - 1)/2)ε^2 - (k(k - 1)(k - 2)/6)ε^3 + ...\\n\\nBut here, k is 1/3 for both expansions. So let me compute the expansion up to the second term because the higher-order terms will become negligible as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, for a:\\n\\n(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ...\\n\\nSimilarly, for b:\\n\\n(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... \\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me verify the coefficients. For (1 + ε)^{1/3}, the expansion is:\\n\\n1 + (1/3)ε - (1/9)ε^2 + (5/81)ε^3 - ... \\n\\nSimilarly, for (1 - ε)^{1/3}:\\n\\n1 - (1/3)ε - (1/9)ε^2 - (5/81)ε^3 - ... \\n\\nSo, up to the second term, that's correct. Therefore, substituting back into a and b:\\n\\na ≈ x^{1/3}[1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2)]\\n\\nb ≈ x^{1/3}[1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2)]\\n\\nTherefore, expanding these:\\n\\na ≈ x^{1/3} + (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3}\\n\\nb ≈ x^{1/3} - (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3}\\n\\nSo, then, a - b ≈ [x^{1/3} + (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3] - [x^{1/3} - (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3}]]\\n\\nSimplifying:\\n\\na - b ≈ (1/3)x^{-2/3} - ( -1/3)x^{-2/3} + [ -1/9 x^{-5/3} - (-1/9 x^{-5/3}) ]\\n\\nWait, let's compute term by term:\\n\\nx^{1/3} cancels out.\\n\\nThen, (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (-1/3)x^{-2/3} = (1/3 + 1/3)x^{-2/3} = (2/3)x^{-2/3}\\n\\nSimilarly, the terms with x^{-5/3}: -1/9 x^{-5/3} - (-1/9 x^{-5/3}) = (-1/9 + 1/9)x^{-5/3} = 0\\n\\nTherefore, a - b ≈ (2/3)x^{-2/3}\\n\\nSo, then, sqrt(x)*(a - b) ≈ sqrt(x)*(2/3)x^{-2/3} = (2/3)x^{1/2 - 2/3}\\n\\nCompute the exponent: 1/2 - 2/3 = 3/6 - 4/6 = -1/6\\n\\nTherefore, sqrt(x)*(a - b) ≈ (2/3)x^{-1/6} = 2/(3x^{1/6})\\n\\nAs x approaches infinity, x^{1/6} approaches infinity, so this would approach 0. But wait, but that contradicts our earlier step where we had the denominator. Hmm, maybe this approach is not accurate enough? Because when we did the expansion of (1 + 1/x)^{1/3} and (1 - 1/x)^{1/3}, we went up to the 1/x term, but maybe we need higher-order terms to capture the difference accurately?\\n\\nWait, let's see. Alternatively, maybe my initial approach using the identity a - b = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2) is more promising. Let's go back to that.\\n\\nSo, we had:\\n\\nsqrt(x)*(a - b) = sqrt(x)*(2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2))\\n\\nWe need to compute the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2. Let's express a and b in terms of x. Again, since a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}, let's factor out x^{1/3} from both terms:\\n\\na = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3}\\n\\nb = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3}\\n\\nTherefore, a^2 = x^{2/3}(1 + 1/x)^{2/3}\\n\\nSimilarly, ab = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} * x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} = x^{2/3}[(1 + 1/x)(1 - 1/x)]^{1/3} = x^{2/3}(1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3}\\n\\nSimilarly, b^2 = x^{2/3}(1 - 1/x)^{2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2 is:\\n\\nx^{2/3}[ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ]\\n\\nSo, factoring out x^{2/3}, the denominator becomes x^{2/3} times [ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ]\\n\\nTherefore, putting it back into the expression:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * [2 / (x^{2/3} * [ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ]) ]\\n\\nSimplify sqrt(x) as x^{1/2}, so:\\n\\n2 * x^{1/2} / (x^{2/3} * [ ... ]) ) = 2 * x^{1/2 - 2/3} / [ ... ] = 2 * x^{-1/6} / [ ... ]\\n\\nSo, 2 / (x^{1/6} * [ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ] )\\n\\nNow, as x approaches infinity, 1/x approaches 0, so we can expand each term in the denominator using the binomial approximation.\\n\\nFirst, let's compute each term in the denominator:\\n\\n1. (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 + (2/3)(1/x) + [(2/3)(2/3 - 1)/2](1/x)^2 + ... ≈ 1 + (2/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) + ...\\n\\n2. (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (-1/3)(1/x^2) + ... ≈ 1 - (1/(3x^2)) + ...\\n\\n3. (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 + (-2/3)(1/x) + [(-2/3)(-2/3 - 1)/2](1/x)^2 + ... ≈ 1 - (2/(3x)) + ( ( (2/3)(5/3) ) / 2 ) (1/x^2) + ... Wait, let me check the expansion:\\n\\nFor (1 - ε)^{k} ≈ 1 - kε + [k(k - 1)/2]ε^2 - ...\\n\\nHere, k = 2/3, ε = 1/x.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 - (2/3)(1/x) + [(2/3)(2/3 - 1)/2](1/x)^2 + ... \\n\\nCalculating the coefficient of 1/x^2:\\n\\n(2/3)(-1/3)/2 = (-2/9)/2 = -1/9\\n\\nSo, (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 - (2/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) + ...\\n\\nTherefore, adding all three terms in the denominator:\\n\\nTerm1: 1 + 2/(3x) - 1/(9x^2)\\n\\nTerm2: 1 - 1/(3x^2)\\n\\nTerm3: 1 - 2/(3x) - 1/(9x^2)\\n\\nAdding them together:\\n\\n(1 + 1 + 1) + [2/(3x) - 2/(3x)] + [ -1/(9x^2) -1/(3x^2) -1/(9x^2) ]\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n3 + 0 + [ (-1/9 - 3/9 - 1/9 ) / x^2 ] = 3 + (-5/9)/x^2\\n\\nSo, the denominator [ ... ] ≈ 3 - 5/(9x^2)\\n\\nTherefore, going back to the expression:\\n\\n2 / [x^{1/6} * (3 - 5/(9x^2)) ] = (2/3) / [x^{1/6} * (1 - 5/(27x^2)) ]\\n\\nAgain, as x approaches infinity, the term 5/(27x^2) is negligible, so we can approximate (1 - 5/(27x^2))^{-1} ≈ 1 + 5/(27x^2) + ... using the expansion 1/(1 - ε) ≈ 1 + ε for small ε.\\n\\nBut since x is approaching infinity, 5/(27x^2) is very small, so multiplying by 1 + 5/(27x^2) would give a term that tends to 0. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to (2/3)/x^{1/6} plus terms that go to 0 faster. Therefore, as x approaches infinity, the whole expression tends to 0.\\n\\nWait, but earlier, when I did the expansion of a - b directly, I also got that the expression tends to 0, but when I first thought of the problem, maybe I expected a non-zero limit? Hmm, perhaps I need to check again.\\n\\nBut both methods lead to the conclusion that the limit is 0. However, maybe there's a mistake in my approximations. Let's cross-verify with another approach. Maybe using substitution.\\n\\nLet me set t = 1/x as x approaches infinity, so t approaches 0. Then, x = 1/t. Let's rewrite the expression in terms of t.\\n\\nFirst, sqrt(x) = (1/t)^{1/2} = t^{-1/2}\\n\\nThen, cube roots:\\n\\ncube root(x + 1) = cube root(1/t + 1) = cube root( (1 + t)/t ) = (1 + t)^{1/3} / t^{1/3}\\n\\nSimilarly, cube root(x - 1) = cube root(1/t - 1) = cube root( (1 - t)/t ) = (1 - t)^{1/3} / t^{1/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the difference:\\n\\ncube root(x + 1) - cube root(x - 1) = [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3} = t^{-1/2} * [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3} = [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3 + 1/2} = [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{5/6}\\n\\nNow, as t approaches 0, we can expand (1 + t)^{1/3} and (1 - t)^{1/3} using their Taylor series around t = 0.\\n\\n(1 + t)^{1/3} = 1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + (5/81)t^3 - ... \\n\\n(1 - t)^{1/3} = 1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - (5/81)t^3 - ... \\n\\nSubtracting these:\\n\\n(1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ [1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2] - [1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2] = (1/3)t - (-1/3)t + [ -1/9 t^2 - (-1/9 t^2) ] = (2/3)t + 0 t^2 + higher order terms\\n\\nTherefore, the numerator is approximately (2/3)t, and the denominator is t^{5/6}. So, the entire expression becomes approximately (2/3)t / t^{5/6} = (2/3) t^{1 - 5/6} = (2/3) t^{1/6} = (2/3) (1/x)^{1/6} = (2/3) x^{-1/6}, which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity. Therefore, this substitution method also gives 0.\\n\\nHmm, so all three approaches seem to indicate that the limit is 0. But let's check with specific large values to see if it makes sense. Let's pick x = 10^6. Then, sqrt(x) = 1000.\\n\\nCompute cube root(10^6 + 1) - cube root(10^6 - 1). Let's approximate:\\n\\ncube root(10^6 + 1) ≈ cube root(10^6) + derivative of cube root at 10^6 * 1\\n\\nThe derivative of x^{1/3} is (1/3)x^{-2/3}. At x = 10^6, this is (1/3)(10^{-4}) = 1/(3*10^4) ≈ 0.000033333.\\n\\nSimilarly, cube root(10^6 - 1) ≈ cube root(10^6) - derivative at 10^6 * 1 ≈ 100 - 0.000033333.\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is approximately 0.000033333 + 0.000033333 ≈ 0.000066666.\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = 1000: 0.000066666 * 1000 ≈ 0.066666...\\n\\nSo, around 2/30 ≈ 0.0666. Wait, but according to our previous calculations, the limit is 0. Hmm, but 0.0666 is a small number, but not zero. However, when x increases further, say x = 10^{12}, then sqrt(x) = 10^6.\\n\\nThe difference cube root(x +1 ) - cube root(x -1 ) ≈ 2 * derivative at x = 10^{12} which is (2/3)x^{-2/3} = (2/3)(10^{-8}) ≈ 0.0000000666.\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = 10^6: 0.0000000666 * 10^6 ≈ 0.0666. So again, same value. Wait, so if x increases, the value approaches approximately 0.0666, which is 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0667. So, 2/30 is 1/15, but 1/15 ≈ 0.0667. Wait, but according to our symbolic calculations, the limit is 0. However, the numerical evaluation for x=10^6 and x=10^12 gives around 0.0666, which is 2/30, which reduces to 1/15. Hmm, this suggests that maybe the limit is 2/3 divided by 3, which is 2/9, but 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps my numerical approach is missing something.\\n\\nWait, let's compute more accurately. Let's take x = 10^6. Then, x + 1 = 1000001, and x - 1 = 999999. Let's compute cube roots.\\n\\nCube root of 1000000 is 100, since 100^3 = 1,000,000. Then, cube root(1000001) can be approximated as 100 + Δ, and cube root(999999) as 100 - Δ.\\n\\nUsing the linear approximation:\\n\\nΔ ≈ derivative at x=100^3=1,000,000 times 1. The derivative of x^{1/3} is (1/3)x^{-2/3} = (1/3)(100^{-2}) = 1/(3*10,000) ≈ 0.000033333.\\n\\nTherefore, cube_root(1,000,001) ≈ 100 + 0.000033333\\n\\nCube_root(999,999) ≈ 100 - 0.000033333\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is approximately 0.000066666\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x)=1000:\\n\\n0.000066666 * 1000 ≈ 0.066666...\\n\\nWhich is approximately 2/30 ≈ 1/15 ≈ 0.0667.\\n\\nBut according to our symbolic calculation, the limit is 0. However, this numerical evaluation suggests that as x increases, the expression approaches approximately 0.0667, which is 1/15. There's a discrepancy here. Therefore, there must be an error in our symbolic calculations. Let's review them.\\n\\nFirst approach: We used the identity a - b = 2/(a^2 + ab + b^2). Then, we approximated the denominator as x^{2/3}[3 - 5/(9x^2)] leading to 3x^{2/3}, so the expression became sqrt(x) * 2/(3x^{2/3}) = 2/(3x^{1/6}) → 0. However, the numerical value contradicts this. Therefore, perhaps the approximation of the denominator was too crude?\\n\\nWait, let's see. When we did the substitution t = 1/x, we ended up with [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{5/6} ≈ (2/3 t) / t^{5/6} = (2/3) t^{1/6} → 0 as t → 0. But the numerical evaluation seems to approach a constant. Therefore, either the numerical evaluation is misleading, or the symbolic approaches are missing something.\\n\\nWait, let's consider higher-order terms in the expansion. Let's go back to the substitution approach where t = 1/x. Then, the expression is [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{5/6}\\n\\nIf we take more terms in the expansion:\\n\\n(1 + t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + (5/81)t^3 - (10/243)t^4 + ...\\n\\n(1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - (5/81)t^3 - (10/243)t^4 + ...\\n\\nSubtracting:\\n\\n(1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ [1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + (5/81)t^3] - [1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - (5/81)t^3] = (2/3)t + (10/81)t^3 + ... \\n\\nTherefore, the numerator is (2/3)t + (10/81)t^3 + ..., and the denominator is t^{5/6}. So, the expression becomes:\\n\\n[ (2/3)t + (10/81)t^3 + ... ] / t^{5/6} = (2/3) t^{1 - 5/6} + (10/81) t^{3 - 5/6} + ... = (2/3) t^{1/6} + (10/81) t^{13/6} + ... \\n\\nSo as t approaches 0, the dominant term is (2/3) t^{1/6}, which tends to 0. However, in the numerical evaluation, when x = 10^6, t = 1e-6, t^{1/6} = (1e-6)^{1/6} = (1e-6)^{1/6} = (1e-6)^{1/6} = 1e-1 = 0.1. Then, (2/3)*0.1 ≈ 0.0666, which matches the numerical result. Similarly, if x = 1e12, t = 1e-12, t^{1/6} = 1e-2, so (2/3)*1e-2 ≈ 0.00666, but in the numerical example, we had x=1e12 giving the same 0.0666? Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no. Wait, when x = 1e12, t = 1e-12, t^{1/6} = (1e-12)^{1/6} = (1e-12)^{1/6} = 1e-2, since (1e-12)^{1/6} = (1e-12)^{1/6} = 10^{-12*(1/6)} = 10^{-2} = 0.01. Therefore, (2/3)*0.01 ≈ 0.006666..., but in reality, for x = 1e12, the actual value would be:\\n\\nsqrt(x) = 1e6.\\n\\nThe difference in cube roots: derivative is (1/3)x^{-2/3} = (1/3)(1e12)^{-2/3} = (1/3)(1e-8) = 1/(3e8) ≈ 3.333e-9. Multiply by 2 gives ≈ 6.666e-9. Then, multiply by sqrt(x)=1e6: 6.666e-9 *1e6 ≈ 6.666e-3 ≈ 0.006666. Which is indeed (2/3)*0.01 ≈ 0.006666. So, as x increases, the value of the expression decreases towards 0. But when x=1e6, t=1e-6, t^{1/6}=1e-1, giving 0.0666, which is 1/15. When x increases to 1e12, it becomes 0.00666, which is 1/150. So, it's approaching 0 as x approaches infinity, but very slowly. Therefore, our symbolic analysis is correct, and the limit is indeed 0. The numerical examples show that as x increases, the value gets smaller, tending towards 0. So even though for x=1e6 it's around 0.0666, for x=1e18, it would be (2/3)*(1e-18)^{1/6} = (2/3)*(1e-3) ≈ 0.000666..., tending to 0.\\n\\nTherefore, all methods confirm that the limit is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{0}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo evaluate the limit \\\\(\\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\\\right)\\\\), we can use algebraic manipulation and asymptotic expansions.\\n\\nFirst, we use the identity for the difference of cube roots:\\n\\\\[\\na - b = \\\\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^2 + ab + b^2}\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(a = \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1}\\\\) and \\\\(b = \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1}\\\\).

Since x is going to infinity, both x+1 and x-1 are going to be very close to x when x is large. But their cube roots might differ by a small amount, and multiplying by sqrt(x) could amplify that difference. The question is whether this product approaches a finite limit, zero, or infinity.\\n\\nI remember that when dealing with limits involving roots, especially differences of roots, expanding them using binomial approximations or using the conjugate can be helpful. But cube roots are a bit trickier than square roots. Let me think.\\n\\nFor square roots, we often multiply by the conjugate to rationalize. For cube roots, maybe we can use the formula for a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). So if I let a = cube root of (x+1) and b = cube root of (x-1), then a^3 - b^3 = (x+1) - (x-1) = 2. Therefore, a - b = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). So maybe I can express the difference of the cube roots as 2 divided by the sum of their squares and their product. Then multiply by sqrt(x). Let's try that.\\n\\nLet me set a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}. Then, as I said, a - b = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). Therefore, the original expression becomes sqrt(x) * 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). So:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * 2 / [ ( (x + 1)^{2/3} + (x + 1)^{1/3}(x - 1)^{1/3} + (x - 1)^{2/3} ) ]\\n\\nHmm, okay. So the denominator is a sum of three terms. Each of these terms is something raised to the 2/3 power or the product of two terms raised to the 1/3 power. Maybe I can factor out x from each term in the cube roots?\\n\\nLet's try to approximate these terms for large x. Since x is approaching infinity, x + 1 ≈ x and x - 1 ≈ x. So maybe I can write (x + 1)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} and similarly for (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3}. Then, using the binomial approximation for (1 + ε)^k ≈ 1 + kε when ε is small.\\n\\nLet me expand each term:\\n\\nFirst, (x + 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\\n\\nSimilarly, (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\\n\\nTherefore, their difference, (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}[ (1 + 1/(3x)) - (1 - 1/(3x)) ] = x^{1/3}(2/(3x)) = 2/(3x^{2/3})\\n\\nWait, but the original expression is sqrt(x) times this difference. So sqrt(x) times 2/(3x^{2/3}) = 2/(3x^{2/3 - 1/2}) = 2/(3x^{1/6}) ) → 0 as x → ∞. But that would imply the limit is zero. But is that right?\\n\\nWait, but maybe the approximation is too crude? Because the higher-order terms might contribute when multiplied by sqrt(x). Let's check this again.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I need to be more precise with the expansion. Let me denote t = 1/x, so as x → ∞, t → 0. Then, (x + 1)^{1/3} = (x(1 + t))^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 + t)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + ... )\\n\\nSimilarly, (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + ... )\\n\\nSubtracting these two, we get:\\n\\nx^{1/3}[ (1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) - (1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) ) ] = x^{1/3}[ (2/3)t - (2/9)t^2 + ... ] = x^{1/3}[ (2/3)(1/x) - (2/9)(1/x^2) + ... ]\\n\\nSo the difference (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ (2/3)x^{-2/3} - (2/9)x^{-5/3} + ...\\n\\nMultiplying this by sqrt(x) = x^{1/2}:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * [ (2/3)x^{-2/3} - (2/9)x^{-5/3} + ... ] = (2/3)x^{1/2 - 2/3} - (2/9)x^{1/2 - 5/3} + ... = (2/3)x^{-1/6} - (2/9)x^{-7/6} + ...\\n\\nAs x approaches infinity, x^{-1/6} approaches 0 and x^{-7/6} approaches 0 even faster. Therefore, the entire expression tends to 0. So according to this approximation, the limit is zero. But wait, I recall that sometimes when you have differences of roots multiplied by a certain power, the limit can be a finite number. Maybe my approximation is missing something?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe using the expansion with more terms? Let me check.\\n\\nWait, but perhaps instead of expanding each cube root separately, I should apply the mean value theorem. For a function f(t) = t^{1/3}, the difference f(x+1) - f(x-1) can be approximated by f'(c)(2), where c is between x - 1 and x + 1. Then, by the mean value theorem, there exists c in (x - 1, x + 1) such that:\\n\\nf(x + 1) - f(x - 1) = f'(c) * 2\\n\\nSo f'(c) = (1/3)c^{-2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is 2/(3c^{2/3})\\n\\nThen, the original expression is sqrt(x) * 2/(3c^{2/3})\\n\\nSince c is between x - 1 and x + 1, as x approaches infinity, c is approximately x. Therefore, c^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, sqrt(x) * 2/(3x^{2/3}) = (2/3) x^{1/2 - 2/3} = (2/3) x^{-1/6} → 0 as x → ∞\\n\\nSo this also suggests the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut maybe there's a mistake here? Because sometimes when using approximations, if the higher order terms are significant when multiplied by another term, but in this case, both methods give zero. Maybe the limit is indeed zero. But let's try another approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the identity for a^3 - b^3 as I initially thought.\\n\\nSo, we have:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * (a - b) = sqrt(x) * ( (a^3 - b^3) / (a^2 + ab + b^2) ) = sqrt(x) * 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2)\\n\\nSince a = (x + 1)^{1/3}, b = (x - 1)^{1/3}\\n\\nSo, a^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 + 2/(3x)), b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - 2/(3x)), and ab ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - 1/(3x^2)) ?\\n\\nWait, let me compute each term:\\n\\nFirst, a^2 = (x + 1)^{2/3} = x^{2/3}(1 + 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}(1 + (2/3)(1/x) - (2/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\\n\\nSimilarly, b^2 = (x - 1)^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (2/3)(1/x) - (2/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\\n\\nab = (x + 1)^{1/3}(x - 1)^{1/3} = [ (x + 1)(x - 1) ]^{1/3} = (x^2 - 1)^{1/3} = x^{2/3}(1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (1/3)(1/x^2) + ... )\\n\\nTherefore, the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}[ (1 + 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 1/(3x^2)) ]\\n\\nWait, let's compute term by term:\\n\\na^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 + (2/(3x)) - (2/(9x^2)))\\n\\nb^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (2/(3x)) - (2/(9x^2)))\\n\\nab ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (1/(3x^2)))\\n\\nAdding these together:\\n\\na^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}[ (1 + 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 1/(3x^2)) ]\\n\\nCombine the constants:\\n\\n1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\n\\nThe terms with 1/x:\\n\\n(2/(3x) - 2/(3x)) = 0\\n\\nThe terms with 1/x^2:\\n\\n-2/(9x^2) -2/(9x^2) -1/(3x^2) = (-4/9 - 3/9)/x^2 = (-7/9)/x^2\\n\\nTherefore, overall:\\n\\na^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(3 - 7/(9x^2))\\n\\nSo, the denominator is approximately 3x^{2/3}, and the correction term is negligible as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, the original expression is sqrt(x) * 2 / (3x^{2/3}) = (2/3) x^{1/2 - 2/3} = (2/3) x^{-1/6} → 0 as x → ∞\\n\\nHmm, so all three methods: binomial expansion, mean value theorem, and the a^3 - b^3 identity lead to the conclusion that the limit is zero. So maybe the answer is zero.\\n\\nBut wait, maybe there is an error here. Let me check with concrete numbers. Let me plug in a very large x, say x = 10^6, and compute the value numerically.\\n\\nCompute sqrt(10^6) * ( (10^6 +1)^{1/3} - (10^6 -1)^{1/3} )\\n\\nsqrt(10^6) = 1000.\\n\\nNow, (10^6 +1)^{1/3} ≈ 100^{2} * (1 + 1/(10^6))^{1/3} ≈ 100^2 * (1 + 1/(3*10^6)) = 10000 + 10000/(3*10^6) ≈ 10000 + 0.003333...\\n\\nSimilarly, (10^6 -1)^{1/3} ≈ 100^2 * (1 - 1/(10^6))^{1/3} ≈ 10000 - 10000/(3*10^6) ≈ 10000 - 0.003333...\\n\\nSo their difference is approximately 0.006666...\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = 1000: 0.006666... * 1000 ≈ 6.666...\\n\\nWait, that's around 6.666, which is 20/3 ≈ 6.666... So this contradicts the previous analytical results that suggested the limit is zero. But when I plug in x = 10^6, the value is approximately 20/3. That's unexpected. Therefore, my previous analytical approach must be flawed.\\n\\nWait, what? So according to numerical evaluation, when x is 10^6, the expression is about 6.666, which is 20/3, but when x approaches infinity, is this approaching a finite limit or going to infinity?\\n\\nWait, but x=10^6 is large, but maybe the limit is a finite number, not zero. So why the discrepancy?\\n\\nWait, my mistake in numerical calculation. Wait, hold on. Let me redo the numerical example more carefully.\\n\\nWait, x = 10^6, so x +1 = 1000001, x -1 = 999999.\\n\\nCompute cube roots:\\n\\nFirst, (10^6)^{1/3} = 100, because (100)^3 = 1,000,000. So 10^6 is (100)^3.\\n\\nTherefore, (10^6 +1)^{1/3} is slightly more than 100, and (10^6 -1)^{1/3} is slightly less than 100.\\n\\nLet me compute the difference:\\n\\nLet me use the binomial approximation for (100^3 + 1)^{1/3} = 100*(1 + 1/100^3)^{1/3} ≈ 100*(1 + 1/(3*100^3)) = 100 + 1/(3*100^2) = 100 + 1/30000 ≈ 100.0000333333\\n\\nSimilarly, (100^3 -1)^{1/3} ≈ 100*(1 - 1/100^3)^{1/3} ≈ 100*(1 - 1/(3*100^3)) = 100 - 1/(3*100^3) = 100 - 1/3000000 ≈ 99.9999996667\\n\\nTherefore, the difference between the two cube roots is approximately 100.0000333333 - 99.9999996667 ≈ 0.0000336666\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = sqrt(10^6) = 1000:\\n\\n0.0000336666 * 1000 ≈ 0.0336666\\n\\nWhich is approximately 0.0337, which is roughly 1/30, which is approximately 0.0333. So in reality, the numerical value is about 0.0337, not 6.666. So my previous calculation was wrong because I miscalculated the cube roots.\\n\\nWait, so 10^6 is (100)^3, so cube root of 10^6 is 100. Then, adding or subtracting 1 would change the cube root by a tiny amount, as shown. So the difference is approximately 0.0000333333, and multiplied by 1000 gives approximately 0.0333, which is 1/30. Wait, 1/30 is approximately 0.0333. So then, this suggests that the limit might be 2/3 / 2? Wait, but 0.0333 is 1/30, which is approximately 0.0333. Wait, but 2/3 divided by 10 is 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0666. Hmm, perhaps not.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the limit is 2/(3*2) = 1/3. Hmm, but 0.0333 is 1/30. So perhaps my numerical evaluation is conflicting with analytical?\\n\\nWait, maybe my analytical approach was wrong. Let me re-examine the steps.\\n\\nSo, earlier, using the binomial expansion, I approximated (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ 2/(3x^{2/3}) - 2/(9x^{5/3}) + ... Then multiplied by sqrt(x) gives (2/3)x^{-1/6} - (2/9)x^{-7/6} + ..., which tends to zero. But the numerical example with x = 10^6 gave approximately 0.0333, which is 1/30, which is x^{-1/6} evaluated at x=10^6: (10^6)^{-1/6} = 10^{-1} = 0.1, then 2/3 * 0.1 ≈ 0.0666, but my numerical calculation gave 0.0333. So there is a discrepancy.\\n\\nWait, that suggests that the next term is subtracting something. Let's compute the exact difference.\\n\\nLet me compute the exact difference for x=10^6.\\n\\nCompute (10^6 +1)^{1/3} - (10^6 -1)^{1/3}.\\n\\nLet me use the identity a - b = (a^3 - b^3)/(a^2 + ab + b^2)\\n\\nHere, a = (10^6 +1)^{1/3}, b = (10^6 -1)^{1/3}\\n\\nThen, a^3 - b^3 = (10^6 +1) - (10^6 -1) = 2\\n\\nThe denominator is a^2 + ab + b^2. Since a and b are both approximately 100, a ≈ 100 + δ, b ≈ 100 - δ, where δ is small.\\n\\nCompute a^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ (100 + δ)^2 + (100 + δ)(100 - δ) + (100 - δ)^2\\n\\nExpand:\\n\\n(100^2 + 200δ + δ^2) + (100^2 - δ^2) + (100^2 - 200δ + δ^2)\\n\\n= 100^2 + 200δ + δ^2 + 100^2 - δ^2 + 100^2 - 200δ + δ^2\\n\\nCombine like terms:\\n\\n3*100^2 + (200δ - 200δ) + (δ^2 - δ^2 + δ^2)\\n\\n= 3*10000 + δ^2\\n\\n= 30000 + δ^2\\n\\nSince δ is very small, δ ≈ (a - 100) ≈ derivative of x^{1/3} at x=10^6 times 1. The derivative is (1/3)x^{-2/3}, so δ ≈ (1/3)*(10^6)^{-2/3} = (1/3)*(100)^{-4/3} = (1/3)*(100^{-1}) )? Wait, (10^6)^{2/3} = (10^6)^{2/3} = 10^{4} = 10000. So derivative is (1/3)*10^{-4} = 1/30000. So δ ≈ 1/(3*10^4) = 0.000033333...\\n\\nTherefore, δ^2 ≈ (1/9)*10^{-8} = negligible.\\n\\nTherefore, denominator ≈ 30000\\n\\nTherefore, a - b ≈ 2 / 30000 = 1 / 15000 ≈ 0.000066666...\\n\\nBut wait, in reality, when we compute a - b numerically, we found approximately 0.000033333... Wait, this is conflicting.\\n\\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, in reality, the cube roots of 10^6 +1 and 10^6 -1 are 100.000033333... and 99.999966666..., so their difference is 0.000066666..., which is 2/(3*10^4) = 2/30000 = 1/15000 ≈ 0.000066666...\\n\\nBut when I multiplied by sqrt(x) = 1000, that gives 1000 * 0.000066666... ≈ 0.066666..., which is 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.066666...\\n\\nBut earlier, my numerical approximation said 0.0333, but that was incorrect. Wait, maybe my first numerical calculation was wrong.\\n\\nWait, let me compute (10^6 +1)^{1/3} and (10^6 -1)^{1/3} more accurately.\\n\\nFirst, (10^6)^{1/3} = 100. Let's compute 100^3 = 1,000,000.\\n\\nCompute (100 + Δ)^3 = 1,000,000 +1. Let me solve for Δ:\\n\\n(100 + Δ)^3 = 100^3 + 3*100^2*Δ + 3*100*Δ^2 + Δ^3 = 1,000,000 + 30,000Δ + 300Δ^2 + Δ^3 = 1,000,001.\\n\\nTherefore, 30,000Δ + 300Δ^2 + Δ^3 = 1.\\n\\nAssuming Δ is very small, the Δ^2 and Δ^3 terms are negligible, so 30,000Δ ≈ 1 → Δ ≈ 1/30,000 ≈ 0.000033333...\\n\\nTherefore, (10^6 +1)^{1/3} ≈ 100 + 1/30,000\\n\\nSimilarly, (10^6 -1)^{1/3} ≈ 100 - 1/30,000\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is (100 + 1/30,000) - (100 - 1/30,000) = 2/30,000 = 1/15,000 ≈ 0.000066666...\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(10^6) = 1000: 1/15,000 * 1000 = 1000/15,000 = 1/15 ≈ 0.066666...\\n\\nSo the correct numerical value is approximately 0.0666..., which is 2/30 = 1/15. Wait, but according to the analytical result earlier, the leading term was (2/3) x^{-1/6}. For x = 10^6, x^{-1/6} = (10^6)^{-1/6} = 10^{-1} = 0.1, so (2/3)*0.1 ≈ 0.066666..., which matches the numerical result. Then, according to the expansion, the next term is -(2/9)x^{-7/6}, which for x=10^6 is -(2/9)*(10^6)^{-7/6} = -(2/9)*10^{-7} ≈ -0.0000000222..., which is negligible. Therefore, the leading term is indeed 0.0666..., which is 2/3 * 0.1 = 0.0666...\\n\\nTherefore, this suggests that as x increases, the expression approaches zero, because x^{-1/6} tends to zero. However, when x = 10^6, the value is still 0.0666..., which is 1/15, and for larger x, it would be smaller. For example, x = 10^{12}, x^{-1/6} = 10^{-2} = 0.01, so (2/3)*0.01 ≈ 0.006666..., which is 1/150. So as x increases, the expression tends to zero. Therefore, the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut wait, then why does the numerical example with x=10^6 give 0.0666, which is non-zero? Because x^{-1/6} approaches zero, but very slowly. For example, to get x^{-1/6} = 0.01, you need x = 10^6. To get x^{-1/6} = 0.001, you need x = 10^{18}, which is extremely large. So even though the limit is zero, for practical purposes, even at x=10^6, the value is still around 0.0666.\\n\\nBut mathematically, as x approaches infinity, x^{-1/6} approaches zero, so the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut now I'm confused because my initial expansion suggested that the difference (x +1)^{1/3} - (x -1)^{1/3} is approximately 2/(3x^{2/3}), and multiplying by sqrt(x) gives 2/(3x^{1/6}), which tends to zero. But let me check with another example. Suppose x approaches infinity, then x^{1/6} also approaches infinity, so 1/x^{1/6} approaches zero.\\n\\nWait, yes. For example, x^{1/6} is the sixth root of x. So as x becomes larger, x^{1/6} increases, so 1/x^{1/6} decreases to zero. Therefore, the expression 2/(3x^{1/6}) tends to zero. Therefore, the limit should be zero.\\n\\nBut the numerical evaluation shows that even at x = 10^6, which is large, the value is 0.0666, which is 2/(3*10^{1/6})?\\n\\nWait, no. Wait, x = 10^6, so x^{1/6} = (10^6)^{1/6} = 10^{1} = 10. So 2/(3*10) = 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0666..., which matches the numerical result. Therefore, the general term is 2/(3x^{1/6}), which tends to zero as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, the limit is zero. Therefore, both analytical approaches and numerical evaluation confirm that, although the expression approaches zero very slowly (since x^{-1/6} decays slowly), it still approaches zero.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer should be zero.\\n\\nWait, but another thought: perhaps when expanding the cube roots, I should have considered higher-order terms?\\n\\nWait, let's use a more accurate expansion.\\n\\nLet me write (x + 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}[1 + (1/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) + (5/(81x^3)) - ... ] using the binomial expansion up to the third term.\\n\\nSimilarly, (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}[1 - (1/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) - (5/(81x^3)) - ... ]\\n\\nSubtracting these two:\\n\\n(x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}[ (2/(3x)) - (10/(81x^3)) + ... ] = (2/(3x^{2/3})) - (10/(81x^{8/3)) + ...\\n\\nMultiplying by sqrt(x) = x^{1/2}:\\n\\nx^{1/2}*(2/(3x^{2/3})) - x^{1/2}*(10/(81x^{8/3)) ) = (2/3)x^{-1/6} - (10/81)x^{-13/6} + ...\\n\\nSo as x approaches infinity, the first term tends to zero, and the second term tends to zero even faster. So indeed, the limit is zero.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the expansion up to the second term:\\n\\nThe difference is approximately (2/(3x^{2/3})) - (2/(9x^{5/3})). Multiplying by x^{1/2}:\\n\\n(2/3)x^{-1/6} - (2/9)x^{-7/6}, both terms go to zero.\\n\\nTherefore, all expansions confirm that the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut wait, another approach: let me set t = 1/x, so as x → ∞, t → 0. Then rewrite the expression in terms of t.\\n\\nLet x = 1/t, so t → 0+.\\n\\nThe expression becomes sqrt(1/t) * [ ( (1/t + 1)^{1/3} - (1/t - 1)^{1/3} ) ] = (1/sqrt(t)) [ ( ( (1 + t)/t )^{1/3} - ( (1 - t)/t )^{1/3} ) ]\\n\\nSimplify inside the cube roots:\\n\\n( (1 + t)/t )^{1/3} = (1/t + 1)^{1/3} = (1/t)^{1/3}(1 + t)^{1/3} = t^{-1/3}(1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + ... )\\n\\nSimilarly, ( (1 - t)/t )^{1/3} = t^{-1/3}(1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - ... )\\n\\nSubtracting:\\n\\nt^{-1/3}[ (1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) - (1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) ) ] = t^{-1/3}[ (2/3)t - (2/9)t^2 + ... ] = (2/3)t^{2/3} - (2/9)t^{5/3} + ...\\n\\nMultiply by (1/sqrt(t)) = t^{-1/2}:\\n\\n(2/3)t^{2/3 - 1/2} - (2/9)t^{5/3 - 1/2} + ... = (2/3)t^{1/6} - (2/9)t^{7/6} + ...\\n\\nAs t → 0+, t^{1/6} → 0, so the entire expression tends to zero.\\n\\nThus, regardless of the approach, the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut the numerical example with x=10^6 gave approximately 0.0666, which is 2/3 * x^{-1/6} = 2/3 * (10^6)^{-1/6} = 2/3 * 10^{-1} = 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0666. So for finite x, even very large, the value is non-zero, but as x grows without bound, it tends to zero.\\n\\nTherefore, the limit is zero.\\n\\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the numerical calculation earlier where I thought the value was 1/30. No, in reality, when corrected, it's 1/15, which aligns with the analytical result.\\n\\nTherefore, after careful consideration and multiple approaches, I conclude that the limit is zero.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{0}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo evaluate the limit \\\\(\\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\\\right)\\\\), we can use several approaches including binomial expansion, the mean value theorem, and algebraic manipulation.\\n\\n1. **Binomial Expansion**:\\n   - Approximate \\\\((x + 1)^{1/3}\\\\) and \\\\((x - 1)^{1/3}\\\\) using binomial expansion for large \\\\(x\\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     (x + 1)^{1/3} \\\\approx x^{1/3} \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{3x} - \\\\frac{1}{9x^2} + \\\\cdots \\\\right)\\n     \\\\]\\n     \\\\[\\n     (x - 1)^{1/3} \\\\approx x^{1/3} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{3x} - \\\\frac{1}{9x^2} + \\\\cdots \\\\right)\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Subtract the expansions:\\n     \\\\[\\n     (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} \\\\approx x^{1/3} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{3x} - \\\\frac{2}{9x^2} + \\\\cdots \\\\right) = \\\\frac{2}{3} x^{-2/3} - \\\\frac{2}{9} x^{-5/3} + \\\\cdots\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Multiply by \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x}\\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{3} x^{-2/3} - \\\\frac{2}{9} x^{-5/3} + \\\\cdots \\\\right) = \\\\frac{2}{3} x^{-1/6} - \\\\frac{2}{9} x^{-7/6} + \\\\cdots\\n     \\\\]\\n   - As \\\\(x \\\\to \\\\infty\\\\), the terms \\\\(x^{-1/6}\\\\) and \\\\(x^{-7/6}\\\\) approach zero.\\n\\n2. **Mean Value Theorem**:\\n   - Let \\\\(f(t) = t^{1/3}\\\\).

So the expression is sqrt(x) multiplied by the difference of two cube roots. Both cube roots are of expressions that are close to x when x is large. So maybe I can approximate the difference between the cube roots?\\n\\nFirst, let me recall that for large x, (x + 1) and (x - 1) are both approximately x. But their cube roots will be approximately cube root of x. However, there's a small difference between them, and when multiplied by sqrt(x), which is also growing, the limit might not be zero. So I need to find a way to expand the cube roots to get a better approximation of their difference.\\n\\nOne technique I remember for dealing with differences of roots is to use the identity a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}). But in this case, we have cube roots, so maybe I can write the difference as (x+1)^{1/3} - (x-1)^{1/3} and then factor out x^{1/3} from both terms?\\n\\nLet me try that. Let's factor x^{1/3} from each cube root:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} = \\\\sqrt[3]{x \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)} = x^{1/3} \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimilarly,\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} = \\\\sqrt[3]{x \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)} = x^{1/3} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSo the difference becomes:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nx^{1/3} \\\\left[ \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} - \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} \\\\right]\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThen, the original expression is sqrt(x) times this, which is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sqrt{x} \\\\cdot x^{1/3} \\\\left[ \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} - \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} \\\\right] = x^{1/2 + 1/3} \\\\left[ \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} - \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{1/3} \\\\right]\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAdding the exponents: 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So that's x^{5/6} times the difference in brackets.\\n\\nNow, I need to approximate the term in brackets. For small h, (1 + h)^{1/3} can be expanded using the Taylor series or binomial approximation. Since 1/x is small when x is large, I can use the expansion:\\n\\n(1 + h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + ... and similarly for (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + ...\\n\\nWait, let me check that. The binomial expansion for (1 + h)^k around h=0 is 1 + kh + (k(k - 1)/2)h² + ..., so for k = 1/3:\\n\\n(1 + h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + (5/81)h³ - ... and so on.\\n\\nSimilarly, (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (5/81)h³ - ...\\n\\nTherefore, subtracting these two expansions:\\n\\n(1 + h)^{1/3} - (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ [1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h²] - [1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h²] = (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (-1/3)h - (-1/9)h²) Wait, let me compute term by term:\\n\\nFirst term: 1 - 1 = 0\\n\\nSecond term: (1/3)h - (-1/3)h = (2/3)h\\n\\nThird term: - (1/9)h² - ( -1/9)h² = 0\\n\\nFourth term: (5/81)h³ - (-5/81)h³ = (10/81)h³\\n\\nBut since h is 1/x, which is very small, maybe up to the h term is sufficient? Let's see.\\n\\nWait, if h = 1/x, then h² = 1/x², which is much smaller than h. So if we approximate up to h, then the difference is (2/3)h. But is that enough? Let's check.\\n\\nIf we take the expansion up to h, then (1 + h)^{1/3} - (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ (2/3)h. However, we are multiplying this difference by x^{5/6}. Let's see:\\n\\nOriginal expression: x^{5/6} * [ (2/3)h + higher order terms ]\\n\\nBut h = 1/x, so substituting h:\\n\\nx^{5/6} * [ (2/3)(1/x) + ... ] = (2/3) x^{5/6 - 1} + ... = (2/3) x^{-1/6} + ... which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity. But this contradicts my initial thought that the limit might not be zero. Hmm, but maybe the first term cancels out, and the next term is needed?\\n\\nWait, maybe I need to go to the next term in the expansion. Let's try expanding up to h³.\\n\\nSo, as per earlier, (1 + h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + (5/81)h³\\n\\nSimilarly, (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (5/81)h³\\n\\nSubtracting them:\\n\\n[1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + (5/81)h³] - [1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (5/81)h³]\\n\\n= (1 - 1) + [(1/3)h + (1/3)h] + [(-1/9)h² + (1/9)h²] + [(5/81)h³ + (5/81)h³]\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n= (2/3)h + 0 + (10/81)h³\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is (2/3)h + (10/81)h³ + higher order terms.\\n\\nSo plugging h = 1/x, we get:\\n\\n(2/3)(1/x) + (10/81)(1/x³) + ...\\n\\nThen, multiplying by x^{5/6}:\\n\\nx^{5/6} * [ (2/3)x^{-1} + (10/81)x^{-3} + ... ] = (2/3) x^{5/6 - 1} + (10/81) x^{5/6 - 3} + ... = (2/3) x^{-1/6} + (10/81) x^{-13/6} + ...\\n\\nAs x approaches infinity, x^{-1/6} approaches 0, and the other terms are even smaller. So according to this, the limit would be 0. But I need to check if this is accurate.\\n\\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the expansion. Let me double-check the coefficients. The binomial expansion for (1 + h)^k is:\\n\\n1 + kh + \\\\frac{k(k - 1)}{2} h² + \\\\frac{k(k - 1)(k - 2)}{6} h³ + ...\\n\\nSo for k = 1/3:\\n\\nFirst term: 1\\n\\nSecond term: (1/3)h\\n\\nThird term: (1/3)(1/3 - 1)/2 h² = (1/3)(-2/3)/2 h² = (-1/9)h²\\n\\nFourth term: (1/3)(-2/3)(-5/3)/6 h³ = (1/3)(-2/3)(-5/3)/6 = (10/81)h³\\n\\nSo yes, that's correct. So up to h³, the expansion is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is (2/3)h + (10/81)h³ + ... So when h = 1/x, substituting:\\n\\n(2/3)(1/x) + (10/81)(1/x³) + ...\\n\\nTherefore, multiplying by x^{5/6} gives:\\n\\n(2/3) x^{-1/6} + (10/81) x^{-13/6} + ... which goes to 0 as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nWait, but that suggests the limit is 0. Is that correct? Let me try to plug in some large x to test.\\n\\nSuppose x is 1,000,000. Then sqrt(x) is 1000. The cube roots:\\n\\nCube root of 1,000,001 vs cube root of 999,999.\\n\\nCube root of 1,000,000 is 100. Then, the cube root of 1,000,001 is approximately 100 + (1)/(3*100²) = 100 + 1/(30,000) ≈ 100.000033333. Similarly, cube root of 999,999 is approximately 100 - 1/(3*100²) ≈ 99.999966666. The difference between them is approximately 0.000066666. Multiply by sqrt(x) = 1000: 0.000066666 * 1000 ≈ 0.066666..., which is about 2/30 ≈ 1/15 ≈ 0.0667. But as x increases, what happens?\\n\\nWait, when x is 1,000,000, we get approx 0.0667, but if x increases further, say x = 10^12, then sqrt(x) is 10^6, and the difference in cube roots would be approx (2)/(3x^{2/3}) because derivative of x^{1/3} is (1/3)x^{-2/3}, so difference approx 2*(1/(3x^{2/3})). Then sqrt(x)*difference is sqrt(x)*(2/(3x^{2/3})) = 2/(3x^{2/3 - 1/2}) = 2/(3x^{1/6}). So as x increases, this expression tends to 0. So for x=10^12, x^{1/6}=10^2=100, so 2/(3*100)=1/150≈0.006666..., which is smaller. So indeed, as x increases, the expression tends to 0. So maybe the limit is 0.\\n\\nBut wait, when I plug in x=1,000,000, I get around 0.0666, and when x=10^12, it's 0.00666, so it's approaching 0. Hence, perhaps the limit is indeed 0. But let me check with another approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the mean value theorem. For a function f(t) = t^{1/3}, the difference f(x+1) - f(x-1) can be written as f'(c)(2), where c is between x-1 and x+1. By the mean value theorem, there exists c in (x-1, x+1) such that:\\n\\nf(x+1) - f(x-1) = f'(c)*(2)\\n\\nSo f'(c) = (1/3)c^{-2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is (2/3)c^{-2/3}\\n\\nSo substituting back into the original expression:\\n\\nsqrt(x)*(2/(3c^{2/3}))\\n\\nSince c is between x-1 and x+1, as x approaches infinity, c is approximately x. Therefore, c^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, sqrt(x)/(x^{2/3}) = x^{1/2 - 2/3} = x^{-1/6} which approaches 0 as x approaches infinity. Hence, the limit is 0.\\n\\nBut wait, but when I computed with x=1,000,000, I had approx 0.0666, which is 2/(3*100) = 2/300 ≈ 0.006666, but wait, no. Wait, x=1,000,000, c≈x, so c^{2/3} = (10^6)^{2/3}=10^{4}=10,000. So sqrt(x) is 1000. So sqrt(x)/c^{2/3}=1000/10,000=1/10. Then multiplied by 2/3: 2/3*1/10≈0.0666. Which matches the earlier approximation. So for x=1,000,000, it's 0.0666, but as x increases, sqrt(x)/c^{2/3}=x^{1/2}/x^{2/3}=x^{-1/6}, which is x^{-1/6}. Therefore, as x approaches infinity, this term approaches 0. So indeed, the limit should be 0.\\n\\nBut I need to check if there is a miscalculation here. Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me set t = 1/x, so as x approaches infinity, t approaches 0. Then rewrite the expression in terms of t.\\n\\nLet x = 1/t, so when x approaches infinity, t approaches 0 from the positive side.\\n\\nSo the expression becomes:\\n\\nsqrt(1/t) [ ( (1/t + 1)^{1/3} - (1/t - 1)^{1/3} ) ]\\n\\nBut wait, (1/t + 1) = (1 + t)/t, and (1/t - 1) = (1 - t)/t. Wait, no:\\n\\nWait, x = 1/t, so x + 1 = 1/t + 1 = (1 + t)/t, and x -1 = 1/t -1 = (1 - t)/t.\\n\\nTherefore, cube roots become:\\n\\n[(1 + t)/t]^{1/3} - [(1 - t)/t]^{1/3} = t^{-1/3} [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ]\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression is:\\n\\nsqrt(1/t) * t^{-1/3} [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ]\\n\\nsqrt(1/t) is t^{-1/2}, so multiplied by t^{-1/3} gives t^{-1/2 -1/3} = t^{-5/6}\\n\\nSo the expression becomes:\\n\\nt^{-5/6} [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ]\\n\\nNow, expand (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} using the binomial expansion for small t:\\n\\nAs before, (1 + t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t² + (5/81)t³ - ...\\n\\n(1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t² - (5/81)t³ + ...\\n\\nSubtracting them:\\n\\n[1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t² + ...] - [1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t² - ...] = (2/3)t + (10/81)t³ + ...\\n\\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\\n\\nt^{-5/6} [ (2/3)t + (10/81)t³ + ... ] = (2/3) t^{1 - 5/6} + (10/81) t^{3 -5/6} + ... = (2/3) t^{1/6} + (10/81) t^{13/6} + ...\\n\\nAs t approaches 0, t^{1/6} approaches 0, and the other terms also approach 0. Therefore, the limit is 0.\\n\\nHmm. So all these methods seem to indicate that the limit is 0. But when I plug in x=1,000,000, I get approximately 0.0666, which is not 0. However, since we're taking the limit as x approaches infinity, even though for finite x the value is non-zero, it tends to 0 as x grows larger. For example, if x=10^12, as I computed earlier, the value would be around 0.00666, which is smaller, and as x increases further, it keeps getting smaller. So that does make sense. Therefore, the limit should be 0.\\n\\nBut let me think again. Maybe there is a different approach? For example, using L’Hospital’s Rule. Wait, but this is an indeterminate form of type ∞ * 0. To apply L’Hospital’s Rule, I need to convert it into a 0/0 or ∞/∞ form.\\n\\nLet me rewrite the original expression:\\n\\nlim_{x→∞} sqrt(x) [ (x+1)^{1/3} - (x-1)^{1/3} ]\\n\\nLet me denote the expression as sqrt(x) * [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] where f(t) = t^{1/3}\\n\\nAlternatively, we can write this as [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] / (1/sqrt(x))\\n\\nSo as x approaches infinity, the numerator tends to 0 and the denominator tends to 0, so it's a 0/0 form. Therefore, maybe L’Hospital’s Rule applies here. Let's try that.\\n\\nLet me set it up:\\n\\nlim_{x→∞} [ (x+1)^{1/3} - (x-1)^{1/3} ] / (1/sqrt(x)) = lim_{x→∞} [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] / (x^{-1/2})\\n\\nNow, take derivatives of numerator and denominator with respect to x:\\n\\nThe derivative of the numerator:\\n\\nd/dx [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] = f’(x+1)*(1) - f’(x-1)*(1) = (1/3)(x+1)^{-2/3} - (1/3)(x-1)^{-2/3}\\n\\nThe derivative of the denominator:\\n\\nd/dx [x^{-1/2}] = (-1/2)x^{-3/2}\\n\\nTherefore, applying L’Hospital’s Rule, the limit becomes:\\n\\nlim_{x→∞} [ (1/3)(x+1)^{-2/3} - (1/3)(x-1)^{-2/3} ] / [ (-1/2)x^{-3/2} ]\\n\\nSimplify numerator:\\n\\n(1/3)[ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ]\\n\\nDenominator:\\n\\n(-1/2)x^{-3/2}\\n\\nTherefore, the expression is:\\n\\n(1/3) / (-1/2) * [ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] / x^{-3/2} = (-2/3) * [ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] / x^{-3/2}\\n\\nSimplify the division:\\n\\n[ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] / x^{-3/2} = [ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] * x^{3/2}\\n\\nAgain, we can factor out x^{-2/3} from both terms in the numerator:\\n\\n(x+1)^{-2/3} = x^{-2/3} (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3}\\n\\nSimilarly, (x-1)^{-2/3} = x^{-2/3} (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\\n\\nx^{-2/3} [ (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3} - (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3} ] * x^{3/2} = x^{-2/3 + 3/2} [ (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3} - (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3} ]\\n\\nCalculate exponent:\\n\\n-2/3 + 3/2 = (-4/6 + 9/6) = 5/6\\n\\nSo x^{5/6} [ (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3} - (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3} ]\\n\\nAgain, expand the terms inside the brackets using binomial approximation for h = 1/x:\\n\\n(1 + h)^{-2/3} ≈ 1 - (2/3)h + ( ( (-2/3)(-2/3 -1) ) / 2 ) h² + ...\\n\\nWhich is 1 - (2/3)h + ( (10/9)/2 ) h² = 1 - (2/3)h + (5/9)h² + ...\\n\\nSimilarly, (1 - h)^{-2/3} ≈ 1 + (2/3)h + ( ( (-2/3)(-2/3 -1) ) / 2 ) h² + ... = 1 + (2/3)h + (5/9)h² + ...\\n\\nSubtracting them:\\n\\n[1 - (2/3)h + (5/9)h²] - [1 + (2/3)h + (5/9)h²] = - (4/3)h + 0 h² + ... = - (4/3)h + ...\\n\\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\\n\\nx^{5/6} [ - (4/3)h + ... ] = x^{5/6} [ - (4/3)(1/x) + ... ] = - (4/3) x^{5/6 -1} + ... = - (4/3) x^{-1/6} + ...\\n\\nWhich tends to 0 as x approaches infinity. Therefore, after applying L’Hospital’s Rule once, we still get an expression that tends to 0. Therefore, the original limit is 0.\\n\\nWait, but if after applying L’Hospital once, we still have an indeterminate form, can we apply it again? Let me check:\\n\\nThe expression after first derivative was:\\n\\nlim_{x→∞} - (4/3) x^{-1/6} + ... which is 0. So actually, after applying L’Hospital once, we have already shown that the limit is 0, so no need to apply it again.\\n\\nTherefore, all methods seem to confirm that the limit is 0. But I want to check another way just to be thorough.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution y = x^{1/6}, so that x = y^6. Then as x approaches infinity, y also approaches infinity.\\n\\nExpress the original limit in terms of y:\\n\\nsqrt(x) = sqrt(y^6) = y^3\\n\\nCube roots:\\n\\n(x +1)^{1/3} = (y^6 +1)^{1/3} ≈ y^2 (1 + 1/(y^6))^{1/3} ≈ y^2 (1 + 1/(3 y^6))\\n\\nSimilarly, (x -1)^{1/3} ≈ y^2 (1 - 1/(3 y^6))\\n\\nSubtracting them:\\n\\ny^2 [ (1 + 1/(3 y^6)) - (1 - 1/(3 y^6)) ] = y^2 [ 2/(3 y^6) ] = 2/(3 y^4)\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = y^3:\\n\\ny^3 * 2/(3 y^4) = 2/(3 y) which approaches 0 as y approaches infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, again, the limit is 0.\\n\\nSo all different methods—binomial expansion, mean value theorem, substitution, L’Hospital’s Rule—lead to the conclusion that the limit is 0. Therefore, I should feel confident that the answer is 0.\\n\\nBut just to make sure, let's consider another perspective. Suppose we write the difference of cube roots as:\\n\\n\\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} = \\\\frac{(x+1) - (x-1)}{(\\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2})}\\n\\nThis is using the identity a - b = (a^3 - b^3)/(a^2 + ab + b^2). Here, a = \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1}, b = \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1}, so a^3 - b^3 = (x+1) - (x-1) = 2.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n\\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} = 2 / [ (\\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2} ) ]\\n\\nSo the original expression becomes:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * [ 2 / ( (\\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} + \\\\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2} ) ) ]\\n\\nNow, let's analyze the denominator:\\n\\nEach term in the denominator is approximately (x)^{2/3} for large x. For example:\\n\\n\\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 + 2/(3x))\\n\\nSimilarly, \\\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} = \\\\sqrt[3]{x² -1} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 - 1/x²)^{1/3} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 - 1/(3x²))\\n\\nAnd \\\\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 - 2/(3x))\\n\\nTherefore, summing these three terms:\\n\\n≈ x^{2/3} [ (1 + 2/(3x)) + (1 - 1/(3x²)) + (1 - 2/(3x)) ] = x^{2/3} [ 3 - 1/(3x²) ]\\n\\nTherefore, the denominator ≈ 3 x^{2/3} - negligible terms.\\n\\nTherefore, the original expression ≈ sqrt(x) * [ 2 / (3 x^{2/3}) ] = (2/3) x^{1/2} / x^{2/3} = (2/3) x^{1/2 - 2/3} = (2/3) x^{-1/6} which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, again, the limit is 0.\\n\\nSo after considering multiple approaches—binomial expansion, mean value theorem, substitution, algebraic identity—all confirm that the limit is 0.

Here, as x is going to infinity, the terms +1 and -1 inside the cube roots become negligible compared to x. But since we have a difference of two cube roots, maybe I need to use some algebraic manipulation to simplify this expression. \\n\\nI remember that for differences of roots, sometimes multiplying by the conjugate helps. For square roots, we multiply by the conjugate to rationalize. Maybe something similar works for cube roots? Let me think. The formula for a^3 - b^3 is (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). So, if I have a - b, where a and b are cube roots, maybe I can multiply numerator and denominator by something to rationalize them. But here, in our case, the expression is part of a product with sqrt(x). So perhaps I need to use this identity.\\n\\nLet me set a = cube root of (x + 1) and b = cube root of (x - 1). Then our expression becomes sqrt(x) * (a - b). If I can express (a - b) in terms that can be simplified, maybe the sqrt(x) will cancel out some terms, making the limit computable.\\n\\nUsing the identity a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2), so rearranged, (a - b) = (a^3 - b^3)/(a^2 + ab + b^2). Let's compute a^3 - b^3 first. Since a is cube root of (x + 1), a^3 is x + 1, and similarly, b^3 is x - 1. Therefore, a^3 - b^3 = (x + 1) - (x - 1) = x + 1 - x + 1 = 2. So, the numerator simplifies to 2. Therefore, (a - b) = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). \\n\\nSo, substituting back into our original expression, the limit becomes:\\n\\nlim_{x→∞} sqrt(x) * [2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2)]\\n\\nWhere a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}. Now, I need to analyze the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2.\\n\\nLet's try to express a and b in terms of x. Since x is approaching infinity, both (x + 1) and (x - 1) are approximately x. So, perhaps we can approximate a and b using a binomial expansion or a Taylor series. Let's consider that approach.\\n\\nFirst, let's write a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}. Let's factor out x from both terms. Then,\\n\\na = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3}\\n\\nSimilarly,\\n\\nb = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3}\\n\\nSo, both a and b can be expressed as x^{1/3} multiplied by a term that's close to 1 when x is large. Then, maybe I can use the expansion (1 + ε)^n ≈ 1 + nε + (n(n - 1)/2)ε^2 + ... for small ε.\\n\\nLet's apply this expansion to both (1 + 1/x)^{1/3} and (1 - 1/x)^{1/3}.\\n\\nFor a:\\n\\n(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... \\n\\nSimilarly, for b:\\n\\n(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... \\n\\nWait, hold on. The expansion of (1 + ε)^k is 1 + kε + (k(k - 1)/2)ε^2 + (k(k - 1)(k - 2)/6)ε^3 + ... For (1 - ε)^k, it's similar but with alternating signs: 1 - kε + (k(k - 1)/2)ε^2 - (k(k - 1)(k - 2)/6)ε^3 + ...\\n\\nBut here, k is 1/3 for both expansions. So let me compute the expansion up to the second term because the higher-order terms will become negligible as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, for a:\\n\\n(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ...\\n\\nSimilarly, for b:\\n\\n(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... \\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me verify the coefficients. For (1 + ε)^{1/3}, the expansion is:\\n\\n1 + (1/3)ε - (1/9)ε^2 + (5/81)ε^3 - ... \\n\\nSimilarly, for (1 - ε)^{1/3}:\\n\\n1 - (1/3)ε - (1/9)ε^2 - (5/81)ε^3 - ... \\n\\nSo, up to the second term, that's correct. Therefore, substituting back into a and b:\\n\\na ≈ x^{1/3}[1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2)]\\n\\nb ≈ x^{1/3}[1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2)]\\n\\nTherefore, expanding these:\\n\\na ≈ x^{1/3} + (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3}\\n\\nb ≈ x^{1/3} - (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3}\\n\\nSo, then, a - b ≈ [x^{1/3} + (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3] - [x^{1/3} - (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3}]]\\n\\nSimplifying:\\n\\na - b ≈ (1/3)x^{-2/3} - ( -1/3)x^{-2/3} + [ -1/9 x^{-5/3} - (-1/9 x^{-5/3}) ]\\n\\nWait, let's compute term by term:\\n\\nx^{1/3} cancels out.\\n\\nThen, (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (-1/3)x^{-2/3} = (1/3 + 1/3)x^{-2/3} = (2/3)x^{-2/3}\\n\\nSimilarly, the terms with x^{-5/3}: -1/9 x^{-5/3} - (-1/9 x^{-5/3}) = (-1/9 + 1/9)x^{-5/3} = 0\\n\\nTherefore, a - b ≈ (2/3)x^{-2/3}\\n\\nSo, then, sqrt(x)*(a - b) ≈ sqrt(x)*(2/3)x^{-2/3} = (2/3)x^{1/2 - 2/3}\\n\\nCompute the exponent: 1/2 - 2/3 = 3/6 - 4/6 = -1/6\\n\\nTherefore, sqrt(x)*(a - b) ≈ (2/3)x^{-1/6} = 2/(3x^{1/6})\\n\\nAs x approaches infinity, x^{1/6} approaches infinity, so this would approach 0. But wait, but that contradicts our earlier step where we had the denominator. Hmm, maybe this approach is not accurate enough? Because when we did the expansion of (1 + 1/x)^{1/3} and (1 - 1/x)^{1/3}, we went up to the 1/x term, but maybe we need higher-order terms to capture the difference accurately?\\n\\nWait, let's see. Alternatively, maybe my initial approach using the identity a - b = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2) is more promising. Let's go back to that.\\n\\nSo, we had:\\n\\nsqrt(x)*(a - b) = sqrt(x)*(2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2))\\n\\nWe need to compute the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2. Let's express a and b in terms of x. Again, since a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}, let's factor out x^{1/3} from both terms:\\n\\na = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3}\\n\\nb = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3}\\n\\nTherefore, a^2 = x^{2/3}(1 + 1/x)^{2/3}\\n\\nSimilarly, ab = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} * x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} = x^{2/3}[(1 + 1/x)(1 - 1/x)]^{1/3} = x^{2/3}(1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3}\\n\\nSimilarly, b^2 = x^{2/3}(1 - 1/x)^{2/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2 is:\\n\\nx^{2/3}[ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ]\\n\\nSo, factoring out x^{2/3}, the denominator becomes x^{2/3} times [ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ]\\n\\nTherefore, putting it back into the expression:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * [2 / (x^{2/3} * [ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ]) ]\\n\\nSimplify sqrt(x) as x^{1/2}, so:\\n\\n2 * x^{1/2} / (x^{2/3} * [ ... ]) ) = 2 * x^{1/2 - 2/3} / [ ... ] = 2 * x^{-1/6} / [ ... ]\\n\\nSo, 2 / (x^{1/6} * [ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ] )\\n\\nNow, as x approaches infinity, 1/x approaches 0, so we can expand each term in the denominator using the binomial approximation.\\n\\nFirst, let's compute each term in the denominator:\\n\\n1. (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 + (2/3)(1/x) + [(2/3)(2/3 - 1)/2](1/x)^2 + ... ≈ 1 + (2/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) + ...\\n\\n2. (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (-1/3)(1/x^2) + ... ≈ 1 - (1/(3x^2)) + ...\\n\\n3. (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 + (-2/3)(1/x) + [(-2/3)(-2/3 - 1)/2](1/x)^2 + ... ≈ 1 - (2/(3x)) + ( ( (2/3)(5/3) ) / 2 ) (1/x^2) + ... Wait, let me check the expansion:\\n\\nFor (1 - ε)^{k} ≈ 1 - kε + [k(k - 1)/2]ε^2 - ...\\n\\nHere, k = 2/3, ε = 1/x.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 - (2/3)(1/x) + [(2/3)(2/3 - 1)/2](1/x)^2 + ... \\n\\nCalculating the coefficient of 1/x^2:\\n\\n(2/3)(-1/3)/2 = (-2/9)/2 = -1/9\\n\\nSo, (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 - (2/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) + ...\\n\\nTherefore, adding all three terms in the denominator:\\n\\nTerm1: 1 + 2/(3x) - 1/(9x^2)\\n\\nTerm2: 1 - 1/(3x^2)\\n\\nTerm3: 1 - 2/(3x) - 1/(9x^2)\\n\\nAdding them together:\\n\\n(1 + 1 + 1) + [2/(3x) - 2/(3x)] + [ -1/(9x^2) -1/(3x^2) -1/(9x^2) ]\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n3 + 0 + [ (-1/9 - 3/9 - 1/9 ) / x^2 ] = 3 + (-5/9)/x^2\\n\\nSo, the denominator [ ... ] ≈ 3 - 5/(9x^2)\\n\\nTherefore, going back to the expression:\\n\\n2 / [x^{1/6} * (3 - 5/(9x^2)) ] = (2/3) / [x^{1/6} * (1 - 5/(27x^2)) ]\\n\\nAgain, as x approaches infinity, the term 5/(27x^2) is negligible, so we can approximate (1 - 5/(27x^2))^{-1} ≈ 1 + 5/(27x^2) + ... using the expansion 1/(1 - ε) ≈ 1 + ε for small ε.\\n\\nBut since x is approaching infinity, 5/(27x^2) is very small, so multiplying by 1 + 5/(27x^2) would give a term that tends to 0. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to (2/3)/x^{1/6} plus terms that go to 0 faster. Therefore, as x approaches infinity, the whole expression tends to 0.\\n\\nWait, but earlier, when I did the expansion of a - b directly, I also got that the expression tends to 0, but when I first thought of the problem, maybe I expected a non-zero limit? Hmm, perhaps I need to check again.\\n\\nBut both methods lead to the conclusion that the limit is 0. However, maybe there's a mistake in my approximations. Let's cross-verify with another approach. Maybe using substitution.\\n\\nLet me set t = 1/x as x approaches infinity, so t approaches 0. Then, x = 1/t. Let's rewrite the expression in terms of t.\\n\\nFirst, sqrt(x) = (1/t)^{1/2} = t^{-1/2}\\n\\nThen, cube roots:\\n\\ncube root(x + 1) = cube root(1/t + 1) = cube root( (1 + t)/t ) = (1 + t)^{1/3} / t^{1/3}\\n\\nSimilarly, cube root(x - 1) = cube root(1/t - 1) = cube root( (1 - t)/t ) = (1 - t)^{1/3} / t^{1/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the difference:\\n\\ncube root(x + 1) - cube root(x - 1) = [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3}\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\\n\\nsqrt(x) * [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3} = t^{-1/2} * [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3} = [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3 + 1/2} = [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{5/6}\\n\\nNow, as t approaches 0, we can expand (1 + t)^{1/3} and (1 - t)^{1/3} using their Taylor series around t = 0.\\n\\n(1 + t)^{1/3} = 1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + (5/81)t^3 - ... \\n\\n(1 - t)^{1/3} = 1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - (5/81)t^3 - ... \\n\\nSubtracting these:\\n\\n(1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ [1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2] - [1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2] = (1/3)t - (-1/3)t + [ -1/9 t^2 - (-1/9 t^2) ] = (2/3)t + 0 t^2 + higher order terms\\n\\nTherefore, the numerator is approximately (2/3)t, and the denominator is t^{5/6}. So, the entire expression becomes approximately (2/3)t / t^{5/6} = (2/3) t^{1 - 5/6} = (2/3) t^{1/6} = (2/3) (1/x)^{1/6} = (2/3) x^{-1/6}, which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity. Therefore, this substitution method also gives 0.\\n\\nHmm, so all three approaches seem to indicate that the limit is 0. But let's check with specific large values to see if it makes sense. Let's pick x = 10^6. Then, sqrt(x) = 1000.\\n\\nCompute cube root(10^6 + 1) - cube root(10^6 - 1). Let's approximate:\\n\\ncube root(10^6 + 1) ≈ cube root(10^6) + derivative of cube root at 10^6 * 1\\n\\nThe derivative of x^{1/3} is (1/3)x^{-2/3}. At x = 10^6, this is (1/3)(10^{-4}) = 1/(3*10^4) ≈ 0.000033333.\\n\\nSimilarly, cube root(10^6 - 1) ≈ cube root(10^6) - derivative at 10^6 * 1 ≈ 100 - 0.000033333.\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is approximately 0.000033333 + 0.000033333 ≈ 0.000066666.\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = 1000: 0.000066666 * 1000 ≈ 0.066666...\\n\\nSo, around 2/30 ≈ 0.0666. Wait, but according to our previous calculations, the limit is 0. Hmm, but 0.0666 is a small number, but not zero. However, when x increases further, say x = 10^{12}, then sqrt(x) = 10^6.\\n\\nThe difference cube root(x +1 ) - cube root(x -1 ) ≈ 2 * derivative at x = 10^{12} which is (2/3)x^{-2/3} = (2/3)(10^{-8}) ≈ 0.0000000666.\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = 10^6: 0.0000000666 * 10^6 ≈ 0.0666. So again, same value. Wait, so if x increases, the value approaches approximately 0.0666, which is 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0667. So, 2/30 is 1/15, but 1/15 ≈ 0.0667. Wait, but according to our symbolic calculations, the limit is 0. However, the numerical evaluation for x=10^6 and x=10^12 gives around 0.0666, which is 2/30, which reduces to 1/15. Hmm, this suggests that maybe the limit is 2/3 divided by 3, which is 2/9, but 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps my numerical approach is missing something.\\n\\nWait, let's compute more accurately. Let's take x = 10^6. Then, x + 1 = 1000001, and x - 1 = 999999. Let's compute cube roots.\\n\\nCube root of 1000000 is 100, since 100^3 = 1,000,000. Then, cube root(1000001) can be approximated as 100 + Δ, and cube root(999999) as 100 - Δ.\\n\\nUsing the linear approximation:\\n\\nΔ ≈ derivative at x=100^3=1,000,000 times 1. The derivative of x^{1/3} is (1/3)x^{-2/3} = (1/3)(100^{-2}) = 1/(3*10,000) ≈ 0.000033333.\\n\\nTherefore, cube_root(1,000,001) ≈ 100 + 0.000033333\\n\\nCube_root(999,999) ≈ 100 - 0.000033333\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is approximately 0.000066666\\n\\nMultiply by sqrt(x)=1000:\\n\\n0.000066666 * 1000 ≈ 0.066666...\\n\\nWhich is approximately 2/30 ≈ 1/15 ≈ 0.0667.\\n\\nBut according to our symbolic calculation, the limit is 0. However, this numerical evaluation suggests that as x increases, the expression approaches approximately 0.0667, which is 1/15. There's a discrepancy here. Therefore, there must be an error in our symbolic calculations. Let's review them.\\n\\nFirst approach: We used the identity a - b = 2/(a^2 + ab + b^2). Then, we approximated the denominator as x^{2/3}[3 - 5/(9x^2)] leading to 3x^{2/3}, so the expression became sqrt(x) * 2/(3x^{2/3}) = 2/(3x^{1/6}) → 0. However, the numerical value contradicts this. Therefore, perhaps the approximation of the denominator was too crude?\\n\\nWait, let's see. When we did the substitution t = 1/x, we ended up with [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{5/6} ≈ (2/3 t) / t^{5/6} = (2/3) t^{1/6} → 0 as t → 0. But the numerical evaluation seems to approach a constant. Therefore, either the numerical evaluation is misleading, or the symbolic approaches are missing something.\\n\\nWait, let's consider higher-order terms in the expansion. Let's go back to the substitution approach where t = 1/x. Then, the expression is [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{5/6}\\n\\nIf we take more terms in the expansion:\\n\\n(1 + t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + (5/81)t^3 - (10/243)t^4 + ...\\n\\n(1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - (5/81)t^3 - (10/243)t^4 + ...\\n\\nSubtracting:\\n\\n(1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ [1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + (5/81)t^3] - [1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - (5/81)t^3] = (2/3)t + (10/81)t^3 + ... \\n\\nTherefore, the numerator is (2/3)t + (10/81)t^3 + ..., and the denominator is t^{5/6}. So, the expression becomes:\\n\\n[ (2/3)t + (10/81)t^3 + ... ] / t^{5/6} = (2/3) t^{1 - 5/6} + (10/81) t^{3 - 5/6} + ... = (2/3) t^{1/6} + (10/81) t^{13/6} + ... \\n\\nSo as t approaches 0, the dominant term is (2/3) t^{1/6}, which tends to 0. However, in the numerical evaluation, when x = 10^6, t = 1e-6, t^{1/6} = (1e-6)^{1/6} = (1e-6)^{1/6} = (1e-6)^{1/6} = 1e-1 = 0.1. Then, (2/3)*0.1 ≈ 0.0666, which matches the numerical result. Similarly, if x = 1e12, t = 1e-12, t^{1/6} = 1e-2, so (2/3)*1e-2 ≈ 0.00666, but in the numerical example, we had x=1e12 giving the same 0.0666? Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no. Wait, when x = 1e12, t = 1e-12, t^{1/6} = (1e-12)^{1/6} = (1e-12)^{1/6} = 1e-2, since (1e-12)^{1/6} = (1e-12)^{1/6} = 10^{-12*(1/6)} = 10^{-2} = 0.01. Therefore, (2/3)*0.01 ≈ 0.006666..., but in reality, for x = 1e12, the actual value would be:\\n\\nsqrt(x) = 1e6.\\n\\nThe difference in cube roots: derivative is (1/3)x^{-2/3} = (1/3)(1e12)^{-2/3} = (1/3)(1e-8) = 1/(3e8) ≈ 3.333e-9. Multiply by 2 gives ≈ 6.666e-9. Then, multiply by sqrt(x)=1e6: 6.666e-9 *1e6 ≈ 6.666e-3 ≈ 0.006666. Which is indeed (2/3)*0.01 ≈ 0.006666. So, as x increases, the value of the expression decreases towards 0. But when x=1e6, t=1e-6, t^{1/6}=1e-1, giving 0.0666, which is 1/15. When x increases to 1e12, it becomes 0.00666, which is 1/150. So, it's approaching 0 as x approaches infinity, but very slowly. Therefore, our symbolic analysis is correct, and the limit is indeed 0. The numerical examples show that as x increases, the value gets smaller, tending towards 0. So even though for x=1e6 it's around 0.0666, for x=1e18, it would be (2/3)*(1e-18)^{1/6} = (2/3)*(1e-3) ≈ 0.000666..., tending to 0.\\n\\nTherefore, all methods confirm that the limit is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{0}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo evaluate the limit \\\\(\\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\\\right)\\\\), we can use algebraic manipulation and asymptotic expansions.\\n\\nFirst, we use the identity for the difference of cube roots:\\n\\\\[\\na - b = \\\\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^2 + ab + b^2}\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(a = \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1}\\\\) and \\\\(b = \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1}\\\\).

Therefore, the limit is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\\\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\\\right) = 0\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the final answer is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{0}\\n\\\\]\",\n",
